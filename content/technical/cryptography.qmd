# Cryptography

## Symmetric Cryptography
Shared Keys. AES. But vulnerability is in sharing the Key between parties.

## Asymetric Cryptography
Public Key Cryptography

RSA and elliptic curve cryptography. Slow than symetric cryptography. Enables secure communication over insecure channels

## Hash functions
These are like digital fingerprints

## Zero-Knowledge Proofs
They solve a unique problem: how can you prove you know something without revealing what you know? Imagine proving you're over 21 without showing your actual birthdate. 

## Homomorphic Encryption
It allows computations to be performed on encrypted data without decrypting it first. Think of it like being able to ask someone to bake a cake following your secret recipe, but without ever revealing the recipe to them. While still computationally intensive, this technology could revolutionize cloud computing and data privacy.

## Post-Quantum Cryptography
cryptographic systems that can resist attacks from quantum computers. This forward-looking field is essential because many current cryptographic systems (especially asymmetric ones) could be broken by powerful quantum computers.
