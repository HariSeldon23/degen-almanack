# Web3 Terminology

## Introduction

Understanding Web3 requires familiarity with a unique vocabulary that spans multiple disciplines: cryptography, economics, computer science, and social coordination. This guide organizes these terms into logical categories and provides clear explanations with relevant examples.

## Evolution of the Web

### Web 1.0 (1990-2004)
The first iteration of the worldwide web consisted primarily of static websites that users could only read. Information flowed in one direction - from website owners to visitors. Think of early news websites or company homepages that rarely changed and offered no interaction.

### Web 2.0 (2004-2020)
The social web emerged, characterized by user-generated content, social networks, and interactive platforms. Users could both read and write content, but platforms owned and controlled the data. Facebook, Twitter, and YouTube exemplify Web 2.0 platforms where users create content but don't truly own or control it.

### Web3 (2020-Present)
The ownership web represents a fundamental shift where users can read, write, and own their digital assets and data. Instead of trusting platforms to manage our digital lives, Web3 uses cryptographic protocols and economic incentives to enable direct ownership and peer-to-peer interactions.

## Core Concepts

### Decentralization

![Decentralization](../../images/decentralization.svg)

Decentralization refers to the distribution of power, control, and decision-making across a network rather than concentration in a single entity. It exists on a spectrum:

1. **Architectural Decentralization**: How many physical computers comprise the system?
2. **Political Decentralization**: How many individuals or organizations control those computers?
3. **Logical Decentralization**: Does the interface and data structures appear more like a single monolithic object, or an amorphous swarm?

Examples help illustrate these distinctions:

- Bitcoin is architecturally and politically decentralized but logically centralized (one shared ledger)
- Email is architecturally decentralized but politically centralized (few major providers) and logically centralized (standardized protocol)
- Language is decentralized across all three dimensions

### Blockchain
A blockchain is a distributed database that maintains a continuously growing list of records (blocks) that are cryptographically linked to previous records. Key characteristics include:

1. **Immutability**: Once data is recorded, it cannot be altered without changing all subsequent blocks
2. **Transparency**: All transactions are public and verifiable
3. **Consensus**: Network participants agree on the state of the system without trusting each other

The term "blockchain" has become somewhat limiting - many modern systems use different data structures while maintaining similar properties. This is why some prefer broader terms like "distributed ledger technology" or "decentralized incentive networks."

## Account Types

### Simple Accounts
Simple accounts represent the most basic way to interact with blockchain networks. They have:

- A public key (like an email address)
- A private key (like a password)
- The ability to hold and transfer native network tokens
- No additional programmable logic

### Smart Accounts
Smart accounts extend simple accounts with programmable functionality:

- Custom validation logic
- Multi-signature requirements
- Automated actions
- Integration with smart contracts

For example, a smart account might require two out of three designated signatures to approve transactions or automatically split incoming payments between multiple recipients.

## Digital Assets

### Native Coins
Native coins (sometimes called protocol tokens) are the primary digital assets of blockchain networks. They serve several purposes:

- Pay for transaction fees (gas)
- Secure the network through staking or mining
- Participate in governance
- Transfer value

Examples include:

- Bitcoin (BTC) on the Bitcoin network
- Ether (ETH) on Ethereum
- SOL on Solana

### Tokens
Tokens are digital assets created on top of blockchain platforms. They differ from native coins because they don't secure the underlying network. Major categories include:

#### Fungible Tokens
Interchangeable tokens where each unit is identical to every other unit. Think of them like traditional currency - any dollar bill can be exchanged for any other dollar bill. Categories include:

- Stablecoins (USDC, DAI)
- Governance tokens (UNI, AAVE)
- Security tokens
- Utility tokens

#### Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs)
Unique digital assets where each token has distinct properties. Common uses include:

- Digital art and collectibles
- Gaming items
- Domain names
- Membership passes
- Real estate titles

## Financial Concepts

### Decentralized Finance (DeFi)
Financial services built on blockchain networks that operate without traditional intermediaries. Key components include:

#### Automated Market Makers (AMMs)
Smart contracts that create liquidity pools allowing users to trade tokens without traditional order books. Instead of matching buyers with sellers, users trade against a pool of tokens with prices determined by mathematical formulas.

#### Yield Farming
The practice of providing liquidity or assets to DeFi protocols in exchange for rewards, typically in the form of governance tokens or trading fees.

#### Impermanent Loss
A unique risk in liquidity provision where the value of assets deposited in an AMM pool can decrease relative to simply holding those assets, due to price movements and the AMM's constant product formula.

## Cultural Terms

### HODL
Originally a misspelling of "hold" that became crypto slang for maintaining long-term positions regardless of market conditions. The term evolved to mean "Hold On for Dear Life" and represents a conviction-based investment strategy.

### Degen
Short for "degenerate," this term began as criticism of high-risk trading behavior but has been reclaimed by the community to describe sophisticated traders who:

- Take calculated risks
- Deeply understand protocol mechanics
- Stay ahead of market trends
- Actively participate in new protocols

### [Gas](../technical/gas.qmd)
Transaction fees paid to network validators, typically priced in the network's native token. Gas prices fluctuate based on network demand, with higher prices during periods of congestion.

### Gwei
A denomination of ETH, specifically 10^-9 ETH. Commonly used to express gas prices on Ethereum and EVM-compatible networks.

## Security Concepts

### Seed Phrase
A sequence of 12-24 words that serves as a backup for private keys. Also called a mnemonic phrase or recovery phrase. The words are selected from a standardized list of 2048 words and must be stored securely, as anyone with access to the seed phrase can control the associated accounts.

### Smart Contract
Self-executing programs stored on a blockchain that automatically enforce and execute agreements between parties. Key characteristics:

- Immutable once deployed
- Transparent and verifiable
- Execute exactly as programmed
- No downtime or censorship
