## Not your keys, not your Coins
![Not your keys](../../images/memes/not-your-keys.jpg)
"Not your keys, not your coins" is one of the most fundamental principles in cryptocurrency, emerging from the early days of Bitcoin and becoming even more relevant after several high-profile exchange failures. This phrase encapsulates a core tenet of cryptocurrency's original vision: true financial self-custody.

The principle is simple but profound: if you don't control the private keys to your cryptocurrency wallet, you don't truly own your cryptocurrency. When you keep your crypto on an exchange or any centralized platform, you're essentially trusting that entity with your assets. The exchange provides you with an IOU - a promise that they're holding your coins safely - rather than giving you direct control over them. This arrangement mirrors traditional banking, where your money is actually a liability on the bank's balance sheet rather than physical cash in your possession.

The significance of this principle has been repeatedly demonstrated through catastrophic exchange failures like Mt. Gox, FTX, and others, where users lost billions because they trusted centralized entities with their crypto assets. Each of these events reinforced the wisdom of the original crypto ethos: the only way to truly own your cryptocurrency is to hold your private keys in a wallet you control. This might mean using a hardware wallet, a properly secured software wallet, or even a paper wallet, but the key factor is that you - and only you - have access to the private keys that control the funds.

This phrase has evolved from a simple security recommendation into a battle cry for cryptocurrency self-sovereignty, encouraging users to take direct responsibility for their assets rather than defaulting to the familiar but potentially risky comfort of centralized custody. It represents not just a practical security measure, but a philosophical alignment with the decentralized, trustless principles that cryptocurrency was built upon.


## HODL
HODL originated as a misspelling of "hold" in a 2013 Bitcoin forum post titled ["I AM HODLING."](https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=375643.0) The post's author, frustrated by their poor trading performance during a Bitcoin price crash, declared they would simply hold onto their Bitcoin rather than try to time the market. The typographical error caught on as both a meme and an investment philosophy in the cryptocurrency community.

The term has evolved beyond its humorous origins to represent a long-term investment strategy often summarized as "Hold On for Dear Life." This reflects the mindset of cryptocurrency investors who maintain their positions despite extreme market volatility, believing in the long-term value proposition of their assets rather than attempting to profit from short-term price movements.

HODL also represents a rejection of traditional trading wisdom. While conventional financial markets emphasize technical analysis and market timing, HODLing suggests that, particularly in the volatile cryptocurrency space, a simple buy-and-hold strategy might outperform active trading for many investors. This approach acknowledges the difficulty of timing a highly volatile, 24/7 global market.

The term has become so influential that it helps identify different types of market participants. "HODLers" are often contrasted with "traders" or "speculators," with HODLers viewed as providing market stability through their long-term commitment to holding assets. During market downturns, the community often encourages "HODL" as a way to maintain conviction and avoid panic selling.

The concept of HODLing has also influenced how blockchain projects design their token economics. Many projects now include staking mechanisms, vesting schedules, and other features that encourage long-term holding, showing how a simple misspelling has evolved into a fundamental aspect of cryptocurrency culture and economics.

## Midwit (Bell Curve) Meme
The meme uses a bell curve (IQ distribution curve) with three characters:

* Left side (low IQ): A simple, happy figure who does something basic but effective. Often called [Smol brain](./terms.qmd#smol-brain)
* Middle of the curve (average IQ): A pseudo-intellectual character with overcomplicated strategies/thoughts, often wearing glasses and trying to sound smart
* Right side (high IQ): Returns to the simple approach but with deep understanding of why it works

## General 

* "Sir, this is a Wendy's": Used when crypto discussions become overly technical or philosophical, reminding people not to take themselves too seriously.
