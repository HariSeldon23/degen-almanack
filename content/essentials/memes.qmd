# Memes
There will be a lot of references to meme's in your journey to become a [Gigabrain](./terms.qmd#gigabrain) Degen. It's important to understand them. Culture is a massive part of Web3 and will help you immensely in your journey. 

## HODL
HODL originated as a misspelling of "hold" in a 2013 Bitcoin forum post titled ["I AM HODLING."](https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=375643.0) The post's author, frustrated by their poor trading performance during a Bitcoin price crash, declared they would simply hold onto their Bitcoin rather than try to time the market. The typographical error caught on as both a meme and an investment philosophy in the cryptocurrency community.

The term has evolved beyond its humorous origins to represent a long-term investment strategy often summarized as "Hold On for Dear Life." This reflects the mindset of cryptocurrency investors who maintain their positions despite extreme market volatility, believing in the long-term value proposition of their assets rather than attempting to profit from short-term price movements.

HODL also represents a rejection of traditional trading wisdom. While conventional financial markets emphasize technical analysis and market timing, HODLing suggests that, particularly in the volatile cryptocurrency space, a simple buy-and-hold strategy might outperform active trading for many investors. This approach acknowledges the difficulty of timing a highly volatile, 24/7 global market.

The term has become so influential that it helps identify different types of market participants. "HODLers" are often contrasted with "traders" or "speculators," with HODLers viewed as providing market stability through their long-term commitment to holding assets. During market downturns, the community often encourages "HODL" as a way to maintain conviction and avoid panic selling.

The concept of HODLing has also influenced how blockchain projects design their token economics. Many projects now include staking mechanisms, vesting schedules, and other features that encourage long-term holding, showing how a simple misspelling has evolved into a fundamental aspect of cryptocurrency culture and economics.

## Midwit (Bell Curve) Meme
The meme uses a bell curve (IQ distribution curve) with three characters:

* Left side (low IQ): A simple, happy figure who does something basic but effective. Often called [Smol brain](./terms.qmd#smol-brain)
* Middle of the curve (average IQ): A pseudo-intellectual character with overcomplicated strategies/thoughts, often wearing glasses and trying to sound smart
* Right side (high IQ): Returns to the simple approach but with deep understanding of why it works
