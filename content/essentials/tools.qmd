## Wallets
A wallet is the primary way you interact with a [Blockchain](../technical/blockchains.qmd). 

Wallets have the following major attributes:

* Type - Hardware or Software wallets
* Platform - Mobile, Browser, Desktop or Hybrid
* [Application Model](../technical/blockchains.qmd#application-models) - Type of blockchains it supports. Can support multiple models. 

| Wallet Name | Type | Platform | Application Models Supported |
|-------------|------|-----------|----------------------------|
| [Ledger](https://www.ledger.com/) | Hardware | Desktop, Mobile | Account (EVM), UTXO, Specialized Account, Resource, Actor |
| [Trezor](https://trezor.io/) | Hardware | Desktop, Browser | Account (EVM), UTXO, Specialized Account |
| [MetaMask](https://metamask.io/) | Software | Browser Extension, Mobile | Account (EVM) |
| [Phantom](https://phantom.app/) | Software | Browser Extension, Mobile | Capability (Solana), Account (EVM) |
| [Safe](https://app.safe.global/welcome) | Software | Browser (Web App) | Account (EVM) |
| [TrustWallet](https://trustwallet.com/) | Software | Mobile | Account (EVM), UTXO, Specialized Account |
| [Rainbow](https://rainbow.me/en/) | Software | Mobile | Account (EVM) |

## Analysis Tools
### API
We'll start off by using [Ortege](https://ortege.ai). For full transparency I own and founded Ortege. This Almanack can and will use data from any trusted source. But in the early days while we require data specifically tailored to our requirements, we will be using Ortege. Anyone contributing however can integrate with any other reputable data sources. 

We break down API's into the following categories:

* RPC Nodes. These are the API's provided by the [Blockchain clients](../technical/blockchains.qmd#clients). Each [Application Model](../technical/blockchains.qmd#application-models) will have a different API structure. The most famous example being the [Bitcon RPC standard](https://developer.bitcoin.org/reference/rpc/) and the [EVM RPC standard](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-1474)
* SQL based. These API's allow you to write SQL against their Datasets. Examples include [Dune](https://dune.com/) and [Flipside](https://flipsidecrypto.xyz/home/). Much like the RPC based API's, these will all have a different API structure. 
* Semantic Layer. Ortege is the first, that I'm aware of, API that aims to abstract away the blockchains implementation away from the developer and provide a uniform API that is consistent across blockchains.

#### Ortege
Coming Soon. 


### Explorers
#### Pure EVM 
Etherscan is the most widely used and has versions on all the major EVM Chains.

## Security Tools
### OpenZeppelin 

## Privacy Tools

### DuckDuckGo

### VPN

The most commercially popular VPN's are ExpressVPN, NordVPN and CyberGhost. I'm not an expert here, but I use Mullvad VPN as it accepts BTC as payment and seems most resitant to state attacks. 

### TOR
