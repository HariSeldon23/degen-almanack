# Gigabrain Degen

## Converting FIAT into a Cryptocurrency

This may be the hardest part of being a Degen. A Degen values privacy. Important to distinguish there is a difference between privacy and secrecy. I'd like my cryptocurrency to display the same characteristics as cash. A means of exchange that has been working just fine for centuries. Cash is private by default and people have seemed pretty happy with that arrangement for over 3 centuries. 

Currently the best way to do this is via:
