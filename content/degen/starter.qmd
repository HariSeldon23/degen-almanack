# Make some money

## Purchasing your first Crypto
While as much as possible I'd like to respect and adhere to the ethos of the early Cypherpunks, there's also the practicality of expecting newcomers to be able to perform some of the advanced requirements that are needed. So we'll take a pragmatic approach and introduce those concepts in incremental levels of difficulty. 

Important things to note:

* You'll need about 10 US Dollars
* We'll be using CEX's to purchase, while understanding the risks and implications
* We'll use a Mobile wallet, Metamask
* We'll use Base, as it's the cheapest L2 with the most activity https://l2beat.com/scaling/costs about $0.003. That means we can do loads of transactions. 

So the first thing anyone entering Web3 needs to do is to purchase some Crypto.

We will use Coinbase as the CEX for this section. You're more than welcome to use your local CEX. If you would like anonymity for your Crypto purchases, please see this section on [Converting fiat into cryptocurrency](../degen/giga.qmd#converting-fiat-into-a-cryptocurrency)

The reason I went with $10 is so that this will work for as many people as possible. Such heart breaking facts:

* The poorest 10% of the world live on less than $2 a day
* About 50% live on less thatn $7 a day

## Your first Degen Strategies

We'll now follow two concurrent strategies.

1. [HODL](../essentials/memes.qmd#hodl)
2. Double my money in 3 years

The goals of the HODL is to hold the safest, most valuable Coin for as long as possible. That's Bitcoin.

The Full Degen part of our strategy is to be super risky. We should almost assume we'll lose this money, the goal is to make outrageous returns.

With HODL, we will do the following:

* Sign up for a CEX
* Purchase $10 worth of ETH
* Create an Account on Metamask
* Transfer the $10 to our Metamask account on Base
* Purchase $5 of [cbBTC](../financial/trollip_index.qmd#cbbtc) https://defillama.com/yields?token=CBBTC
* Supply it to Aave. Although Spark may be of interest to qualify for the airdrop. The APR between the two is neglible. We'll go with Aave as it's safer for now. $5 bucks of an Airdrop isn't worth the extra risk.
* In order to double our money in 3 years, which is very good, you need to get 24% APR. Makes sense to just use USDX on Arbitrum
