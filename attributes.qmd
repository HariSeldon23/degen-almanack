Proxy Stock
Types of Proxy Stocks
Bitcoin-Focused Companies
These are firms directly involved in Bitcoin acquisition, mining, or blockchain technology:
MicroStrategy (MSTR):
MicroStrategy is a business intelligence company that holds significant amounts of Bitcoin on its balance sheet.
As of 2024, it is one of the largest corporate holders of Bitcoin, making its stock highly correlated to Bitcoin's price movements.
Marathon Digital Holdings (MARA) and Riot Platforms (RIOT):
These are Bitcoin mining companies. Their revenue and stock prices are heavily influenced by the price of Bitcoin and mining difficulty.
Hut 8 Mining (HUT):
Another major Bitcoin mining company with a strong treasury of self-mined Bitcoin.
Payment Companies with Bitcoin Exposure
These firms integrate Bitcoin into their payment systems or hold it as part of their investments:
Block (formerly Square) (SQ):
Block, founded by Jack Dorsey, integrates Bitcoin into its Cash App and has invested a portion of its treasury into Bitcoin.
PayPal (PYPL):
PayPal allows users to buy, sell, and hold Bitcoin. While its exposure to Bitcoin isn't as direct as MicroStrategy's, it still benefits from increased adoption.
Cryptocurrency Exchanges
Exchanges generate significant revenue from Bitcoin trading:
Coinbase (COIN):
Coinbase is a publicly traded cryptocurrency exchange. Its revenue is linked to trading activity, which tends to rise with Bitcoinâ€™s price.
ETFs or Trusts Holding Bitcoin
These are not technically "stocks" but trade like stocks and are backed by Bitcoin:
Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC):
GBTC holds Bitcoin and allows investors to gain exposure without directly buying or storing it. However, it often trades at a premium or discount to its net asset value (NAV).
ProShares Bitcoin Strategy ETF (BITO):
This ETF invests in Bitcoin futures rather than Bitcoin itself.
Broader Technology Companies with Bitcoin Investments
These firms may invest in Bitcoin as part of their broader innovation strategies:
Tesla (TSLA):
Tesla briefly held Bitcoin as part of its treasury management strategy and accepts Bitcoin for some products (though policy has fluctuated).
NVIDIA (NVDA):
While not directly holding Bitcoin, NVIDIA benefits from the Bitcoin ecosystem by selling GPUs used in mining operations.


## Risks 
Sub categories of risks include
smart contract vulns
regulatory risks
centralization risks for CeDeFi and CEX's 
MEV
network level
key and wallet compromise
cross chain exploits
oracle manipulation 
Social engineering 
exploitation of economic models 
Smart Contract Vulns
Smart contract vulnerabilities represent one of the most critical risks in Web3, having led to billions in losses. This analysis examines major exploit categories based on historical hacks, their prevalence across different application models, and effective mitigation strategies.

Subcategories are:
Access Control Flaws
Logic and Arithmetic Errors
Oracle Manipulation
Reentrancy attacks
Flash Loan Vulnerabilities

Reentrancy attacks
Mainly on Solidity. Famous example is the DAO hack which resulted in the Ethereum. pre 0.4.0 of Solidity there were no built in protections, so completely vulnerable. 

Pre-0.4.0: No built-in protections, completely vulnerable
0.4.0-0.4.12: Introduction of the transfer() function with 2300 gas stipend, providing some protection but not comprehensive
0.4.13-0.7.x: Better compiler warnings about state changes after external calls
0.8.0+: Enhanced static analysis for potential reentrancy, but still requires explicit protection

OpenZeppelin's ReentrancyGuard became the gold standard for protecting against these attacks. 

Move, used by Sui and Aptos, takes a different approach. It uses a linear type system that treats resources as non-duplicatable assets. This makes traditional reentrancy attacks much harder because resources can't be accessed multiple times in the same transaction. However, parallel execution in Sui could potentially create new forms of reentrancy-like vulnerabilities.

High Risk (without additional protections):
Solidity (EVM) - Requires explicit guards and careful external call handling
Medium Risk:
Cairo (StarkNet) - Possible but harder to accidentally create
Cadence (Flow) - Resource model helps but inter-contract calls need attention
Low Risk (by design):
Move (Sui/Aptos) - Linear type system prevents traditional reentrancy
Rust (Solana) - Execution model prevents traditional reentrancy
Vyper (EVM) - Built-in restrictions prevent common reentrancy patterns
Clarity (Stacks) - Decidability and no recursive calls prevent traditional reentrancy
