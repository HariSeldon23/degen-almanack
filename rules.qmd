Decentralization
We have have two forms of decentralization, a binary representation and scale. When we refer to decentralization without referencing the rung it exists on in the scale, that means we are referring to the binary definition. 

The binary definition means more than one machine as denoted by having more than one unique:
IP address
on chain address

It's important to note that this metric is easily manipulated. For example, I can spin up numerous unique on chain addresses for my dapp to showcase my decentralization and since no-one can prove ownership of those addresses, I could own all addresses and therefore be fundamentally centralized.
