# Introduction

The genesis of this book was reading a technical argument on Twitter that was steeped in ideology. I agreed with both parties on certain points, yet the two combatants resorted to ad hominem attacks, both lacking a standardized framework in which to couch their arguments. This led me to rekindle an idea I'd had years before, to create a blockchain taxonomy. Something that would be easily accessible and would be able to be used to quickly dispel bad faith arguments. 

After building out the initial taxonomy, the breadth of the task started to dawn on me. The potential of it could be expanded to provide value not just to the technical community but to all parties interested in blockchain technology. I kept recalling the numerous conversations with family and friends asking for crypto investment advice. This wonderful patchwork of humanity I've had the fortune of spending my life with and how I could never give them an answer that spanned the breadth of this fascinating industry I love. Even sadder, I had no way of giving them advice concise enough for them to follow, that matched their investment goals. 

What then if there was a book, an Almanack for lack of a better word, that I could give to these people. A book that would educate, illuminate and help them make well informed investing decisions. While still straddling a fine line of being technically honest on how to safely navigate these waters. 

Taking a cue from history, following in the footsteps of [Henry Vanrum Poor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henry_Varnum_Poor) when he recognized the need for reliable information about the booming railroad companies. This takes inspiration from that venture with a modern twist. In line with the cypherpunk manifesto[@hughes1993cypherpunk] and the open source communities [@raymond1999cathedral] which I admire so much, this Almanack will be open source and community contributed. As a core tenet of the Cypherpunk manifesto, contributors identity will be less important than their reputation. The knowledge will be curated and go through an approval process via [Github Pull Requests](https://github.com/HariSeldon23/degen-almanack/pulls). The other innovation is that as the Alamack evolves over time it will integrate with real time data sources in order to provide a dynamic document that plugs into the market as it evolves. 

A brief note on the naming of the book. Initially I wanted to call it blockchain taxonomy, reflecting it's early design goals. However as I worked more and more and it evolved into something much broader than a Taxonomy, Almanack made a lot more sense. Initially I liked Trollip's Web3 Almanack. But all the broader terms for this industry have severe limitations. I consider myself a degen. And while it's a loaded term, it's being a degen that has armed me with the knowledge to attempt this ambitious venture. Hence Trollip's Degen Almanack.
