## Motivation

Knowledge critical to achieving financial sovereignty should never be locked behind paywalls or restrictions. The crypto industry already suffers from enough artificial barriers - gated Discord servers, exclusive research groups, and insider knowledge networks that perpetuate inequality.

This Almanack exists to break down these barriers. Just as Bitcoin enables permissionless financial transactions, this work aims to enable permissionless learning. However, we must also prevent others from creating new barriers around this knowledge.

This is why we've chosen the Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike 4.0 International License (CC BY-SA 4.0). This copyleft license ensures that:

1. Anyone can freely access, share, and build upon this work
2. Any derivative works must maintain the same freedoms
3. Commercial use is permitted, but cannot restrict access
4. Attribution protects the community's contributions
5. The viral nature of ShareAlike prevents future enclosure

Think of it like a smart contract for knowledge: immutable rules that protect freedom while enabling innovation.
