# Crypto Terms

## Basic Terms
### Web3

![Evolution of the Web](./images/web3.svg)

* Web1 (1990s): static websites, read-only content
* Web2 (2000s - 2010s): Interactive social platforms, user-generated content
* Web3 (2020s+): Decentralized networks, blockchain, user-owned data and assets

#### Decentralization

### Blockchains
#### Layer 1 {#layer-1}
Currently there is no universally accepted definition of what comprises a L1 Network. 

We have token these sources in order to come up with our approximation
[@nakamoto2008bitcoin] for Bitcoin
[@buterin2013ethereum] for Ethereum
[@buterin2021rollups] for the rollups guide
[@charbonneau2023rollups] for the John's excellent guide

Nakamoto's Bitcoin whitepaper, while not explicitly using the term "Layer 1," established the core principles of what we now recognize as Layer 1 characteristics: a base protocol that handles consensus, security, and data availability without relying on any other blockchain system. This introduced the concept of a `self-contained, sovereign blockchain network`.

The Ethereum whitepaper expanded this foundation by introducing programmability and demonstrating that a Layer 1 could be more than just a payment system. It showed that a Layer 1 blockchain serves as a foundation for broader computational capabilities while maintaining the core properties of decentralization and security.

Buterin's rollup guide helps define Layer 1 by contrast - it clarifies what makes a base layer distinct from scaling solutions built on top of it. This work emphasizes that a Layer 1 blockchain must handle three critical functions: data availability, consensus, and execution, all while maintaining decentralization.

The Delphi Digital report further refines our understanding by examining how Layer 1 blockchains interact with scaling solutions, highlighting their role as the security and settlement layer of the blockchain ecosystem.

Synthesizing these sources, we can define a Layer 1 blockchain as:

A sovereign blockchain network that provides three fundamental guarantees without relying on any other blockchain system: (1) consensus - the ability to agree on the state of the network, (2) data availability - ensuring all transaction data is publicly accessible and verifiable, and (3) execution - the processing of transactions and state changes. It must do this while maintaining decentralization in its security model and serving as the ultimate settlement layer where the final state of all transactions is recorded.

#### Layer 2
There is no canonical definition of L2's.

## Colloqualisms
### HODL
HODL originated as a misspelling of "hold" in a 2013 Bitcoin forum post titled "I AM HODLING." The post's author, frustrated by their poor trading performance during a Bitcoin price crash, declared they would simply hold onto their Bitcoin rather than try to time the market. The typographical error caught on as both a meme and an investment philosophy in the cryptocurrency community.

The term has evolved beyond its humorous origins to represent a long-term investment strategy often summarized as "Hold On for Dear Life." This reflects the mindset of cryptocurrency investors who maintain their positions despite extreme market volatility, believing in the long-term value proposition of their assets rather than attempting to profit from short-term price movements.

HODL also represents a rejection of traditional trading wisdom. While conventional financial markets emphasize technical analysis and market timing, HODLing suggests that, particularly in the volatile cryptocurrency space, a simple buy-and-hold strategy might outperform active trading for many investors. This approach acknowledges the difficulty of timing a highly volatile, 24/7 global market.

The term has become so influential that it helps identify different types of market participants. "HODLers" are often contrasted with "traders" or "speculators," with HODLers viewed as providing market stability through their long-term commitment to holding assets. During market downturns, the community often encourages "HODL" as a way to maintain conviction and avoid panic selling.

The concept of HODLing has also influenced how blockchain projects design their token economics. Many projects now include staking mechanisms, vesting schedules, and other features that encourage long-term holding, showing how a simple misspelling has evolved into a fundamental aspect of cryptocurrency culture and economics.

### Degens
"Degen" (short for "degenerate") in crypto/Web3 culture refers to aggressive or risk-seeking participants in cryptocurrency markets and DeFi (decentralized finance) protocols. The term originated from gambling culture but has been embraced by the crypto community as a semi-ironic badge of honor.

* Trading Behavior: Degens are known for taking high-risk positions, often using significant leverage, and engaging in yield farming, liquidity mining, and other complex DeFi strategies.
* Cultural Identity: Unlike traditional finance's negative connotation of "degenerate gambling," the crypto community has reclaimed "degen" as a positive or playful identifier. It represents a willingness to experiment with new protocols and take calculated risks.
* Technical Sophistication: Despite the seeming recklessness implied by the term, many "degens" are highly knowledgeable about blockchain technology, smart contracts, and DeFi mechanics. They're often early adopters of new protocols and technologies.
* Community Role: Degens play an important role in crypto ecosystems by providing early liquidity to new protocols, testing experimental features, and contributing to the rapid evolution of DeFi products.
