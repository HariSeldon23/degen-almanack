# Welcome {.unnumbered}

This Almanack represents an attempt to document cryptocurrency and Web3 knowledge without the conflicts of interest that plague our industry. Just as Henry Varnum Poor created his Manual of Railroads to bring transparency to America's railroad boom, this Almanack aims to bring clarity to the cryptocurrency industry.

## Why This Almanack Exists

The cryptocurrency industry suffers from a unique problem: those with the deepest knowledge often have the strongest financial incentives to mislead others. Protocol developers promote their own chains, influencers pump their own holdings, and "researchers" serve those who pay them. Meanwhile, crucial information remains locked behind paywalls and exclusive groups.

This Almanack breaks that pattern by providing:

- Comprehensive knowledge from basic concepts to advanced strategies
- Independent analysis free from token-holder influence
- Technical depth that doesn't sacrifice accessibility
- Practical guidance for both users and developers

## How to Use This Almanack

Whether you're seeking financial sovereignty or building the future, this Almanack offers multiple paths:

**For Those Seeking Independence**  
Start with ["Regular Person's Path to Independence"](./content/independence/independence.qmd) to understand how to safely participate in the cryptocurrency ecosystem without falling prey to scams or losing your funds.

**For Technical Minds**
