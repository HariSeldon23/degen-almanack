For my two princes. Huxley & Morrissey.

For my bois, the Lord's of Slumtown.

## Why I must write 
So that I can continue to use crypto without dishonor, I have decided to put together a sufficient body of free research so that I will be able to get along without any knowledge that is not free and accessible by anyone. 

## Why many others want to help
I have found that many within crypto are unhappy with the exploitation of digital currencies. The influx of grifters, charlatons and scammers. It may enable them to make more money, but it requires them to feel in conflict with humanity rather than feel as comrades. 

The fundamental act of friendship among [degens](./technolect.qmd#degens) is the sharing of knowledge. Knowledge in crypto, due to it's technical complexity has attracted a special type of exploitation. High pay walls for access to data goes against the very ethos of Web3. 

## How you can contribute
Currently you can contribute by submitting knowledge in the form of a Pull Request to the [Github repo](https://github.com/HariSeldon23/web3-almanack).

I'm considering opening up this document onto [Mirror](https://mirror.xyz/) so people can donate financially and anonymously through there. I still need to do more research on [Open Source financial models](http://www.catb.org/~esr/writings/magic-cauldron/) to ensure this Almanack can operate sustainably as a going concern. 

Stay Tuned!
