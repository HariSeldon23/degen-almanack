It may enable them to make more money, but it requires them to feel in conflict with humanity rather than feel as comrades.\nThe fundamental act of friendship among degens is the sharing of knowledge. Knowledge in crypto, due to it’s technical complexity has attracted a special type of exploitation. High pay walls for access to data goes against the very ethos of Web3.",

    "text": "The genesis of this book was reading a technical argument on Twitter that was steeped in ideology. I agreed with both parties on certain points, yet the two combatants resorted to ad hominen attacks, both lacking a standardized framework in which to couch their arguments. This led me to rekindle an idea I’d had years before, to create a blockchain taxonomy. Something that would be easily accessible and would be able to be used to quickly dispel bad faith arguments.\nAfter building out the initial taxonomy, the breadth of the task started to dawn on me. The potential of it could be expanded to provide value not just to the technical community but to all parties interested in blockchain technology. I kept recalling the numerous conversations with family and friends asking for crypto investment advice. This wonderful patchwork of humanity I’ve had the fortune of spending my life with and how I could never give them an answer that spanned the breadth of this fascinating industry I love. Even sadder, I had no way of giving them advice concise enough for them to follow, that matched their investment goals.\nWhat then if there was a book, an Almanack for lack of a better word, that I could give to these people. A book that would educate, illuminate and help them make well informed investing decisions. While still straddling a fine line of being technically honest on how to safely navigate these waters.\nTaking a cue from history, following in the footsteps of Henry Vanrum Poor when he recognized the need for reliable information about the booming railroad companies. This takes inspiration from that venture with a modern twist. In line with the cypherpunk manifesto (Hughes 1993) and the open source communities(DiBona, Ockman, and Stone 1999) which I admire so much, this Almanack will be open source and community contributed. As a core tenet of the Cypherpunk manifesto, contributors identity will be less important than their reputation. The knowledge will be curated and go through an approval process via Github Pull Requests. The other innovation is that as the Alamack evolves over time it will integrate with real time data sources in order to provide a dynamic document that plugs into the market as it evolves.\nA brief note on the naming of the book. Initially I wanted to call it blockchain taxonomy, reflecting it’s early design goals. However as I worked more and more and it evolved into something much broader than a Taxonomy, Almanack made a lot more sense. Initially I liked Trollip’s Web3 Almanack. But all the broader terms for this industry have severe limitations. I consider myself a degen. And while it’s a loaded term, it’s being a degen that has armed me with the knowledge to attempt this ambitious venture. Hence Trollip’s Degen Almanack.\n\n\n\n\nDiBona, Chris, Sam Ockman, and Mark Stone. 1999. Open Sources: Voices from the Open Source Revolution.

This introduced the concept of a self-contained, sovereign blockchain network.\nThe Ethereum whitepaper expanded this foundation by introducing programmability and demonstrating that a Layer 1 could be more than just a payment system. It showed that a Layer 1 blockchain serves as a foundation for broader computational capabilities while maintaining the core properties of decentralization and security.\nButerin’s rollup guide helps define Layer 1 by contrast - it clarifies what makes a base layer distinct from scaling solutions built on top of it. This work emphasizes that a Layer 1 blockchain must handle three critical functions: data availability, consensus, and execution, all while maintaining decentralization.\nThe Delphi Digital report further refines our understanding by examining how Layer 1 blockchains interact with scaling solutions, highlighting their role as the security and settlement layer of the blockchain ecosystem.\nSynthesizing these sources, we can define a Layer 1 blockchain as:\nA sovereign blockchain network that provides three fundamental guarantees without relying on any other blockchain system: (1) consensus - the ability to agree on the state of the network, (2) data availability - ensuring all transaction data is publicly accessible and verifiable, and (3) execution - the processing of transactions and state changes. It must do this while maintaining decentralization in its security model and serving as the ultimate settlement layer where the final state of all transactions is recorded.",

    "section": "2.5 Degen Slang",
    "text": "2.5 Degen Slang\n\n2.5.1 HODL\nHODL originated as a misspelling of “hold” in a 2013 Bitcoin forum post titled “I AM HODLING.” The post’s author, frustrated by their poor trading performance during a Bitcoin price crash, declared they would simply hold onto their Bitcoin rather than try to time the market. The typographical error caught on as both a meme and an investment philosophy in the cryptocurrency community.\nThe term has evolved beyond its humorous origins to represent a long-term investment strategy often summarized as “Hold On for Dear Life.” This reflects the mindset of cryptocurrency investors who maintain their positions despite extreme market volatility, believing in the long-term value proposition of their assets rather than attempting to profit from short-term price movements.\nHODL also represents a rejection of traditional trading wisdom. While conventional financial markets emphasize technical analysis and market timing, HODLing suggests that, particularly in the volatile cryptocurrency space, a simple buy-and-hold strategy might outperform active trading for many investors. This approach acknowledges the difficulty of timing a highly volatile, 24/7 global market.\nThe term has become so influential that it helps identify different types of market participants. “HODLers” are often contrasted with “traders” or “speculators,” with HODLers viewed as providing market stability through their long-term commitment to holding assets. During market downturns, the community often encourages “HODL” as a way to maintain conviction and avoid panic selling.\nThe concept of HODLing has also influenced how blockchain projects design their token economics. Many projects now include staking mechanisms, vesting schedules, and other features that encourage long-term holding, showing how a simple misspelling has evolved into a fundamental aspect of cryptocurrency culture and economics.\n\n\n2.5.2 Degens\n“Degen” (short for “degenerate”) in crypto/Web3 culture refers to aggressive or risk-seeking participants in cryptocurrency markets and DeFi (decentralized finance) protocols. The term originated from gambling culture but has been embraced by the crypto community as a semi-ironic badge of honor.\n\nTrading Behavior: Degens are known for taking high-risk positions, often using significant leverage, and engaging in yield farming, liquidity mining, and other complex DeFi strategies.\nCultural Identity: Unlike traditional finance’s negative connotation of “degenerate gambling,” the crypto community has reclaimed “degen” as a positive or playful identifier. It represents a willingness to experiment with new protocols and take calculated risks.\nTechnical Sophistication: Despite the seeming recklessness implied by the term, many “degens” are highly knowledgeable about blockchain technology, smart contracts, and DeFi mechanics. They’re often early adopters of new protocols and technologies.\nCommunity Role: Degens play an important role in crypto ecosystems by providing early liquidity to new protocols, testing experimental features, and contributing to the rapid evolution of DeFi products.\n\n\n\n\n\nButerin, Vitalik. 2013. “Ethereum White Paper: A Next Generation Smart Contract & Decentralized Application Platform.” https://ethereum.org/en/whitepaper/.\n\n\n———. 2021. “An Incomplete Guide to Rollups.” https://vitalik.ca/general/2021/01/05/rollup.html.\n\n\nCharbonneau, Jon. 2023. “The Complete Guide to Rollups.” Research Report.

As such we don’t refer to networks here by Layer 1 or Layer 2. That’s a classification and distinction you can explore here.\nWe define a Base Network that maintains it’s own Sovereignity.

This reflects a hat tip to the Fat protocol metaphor.

We can start with Base, Arbitrum, BSC, Optimism and Polygon.\nLet’s build a comprehensive framework for tracking the true “Ozempic effect” of L2s on Ethereum. We’ll need several interconnected metrics to understand the complete value flow dynamics.\n\nWallet Migration Analysis\n\n\nTrack addresses that first appeared on Ethereum before a certain date (let’s call them “Ethereum Native Wallets”)\nMonitor their activity transition to L2s over time\nAnalyze their ETH holdings distribution between L1 and L2s\nCalculate the ratio of their transaction activity on L2s versus L1\n\n\nL2 Native User Analysis\n\n\nIdentify wallets that first appeared on L2s\nTrack what percentage never bridge to Ethereum\nMeasure their total value held\nCalculate their transaction activity\n\n\nFee Flow Dynamics\n\n\nTrack L2 sequencer fees paid back to Ethereum\nCalculate the net fee difference (what these transactions would have cost on L1 versus actual L2 + L1 calldata costs)\nMonitor the ratio of fees paid back to Ethereum versus fees retained by the L2\n\nWe could create a composite “Value Migration Score” that looks like:\ndef calculate_migration_score(l2_data):\n    # Value Migration\n    eth_native_migration = (\n        eth_native_wallets_on_l2 / total_eth_native_wallets *\n        eth_value_moved_to_l2 / original_eth_holdings\n    )\n    \n    # Activity Migration\n    activity_migration = (\n        l2_transactions_by_eth_wallets / \n        (l1_transactions_by_eth_wallets + l2_transactions_by_eth_wallets)\n    )\n    \n    # L2 Native Growth\n    l2_native_strength = (\n        l2_only_wallets / total_l2_wallets *\n        l2_native_value / total_l2_value\n    )\n    \n    # Fee Economics\n    fee_efficiency = (\n        sequencer_fees_to_ethereum / \n        theoretical_l1_fees_for_same_transactions\n    )\n    \n    return (\n        eth_native_migration * 0.3 +\n        activity_migration * 0.3 +\n        l2_native_strength * 0.2 +\n        fee_efficiency * 0.2\n    )\nThis would give us a quantitative measure of how effectively an L2 is: 1. Attracting value from Ethereum 2. Generating new value through native users 3. Maintaining a sustainable fee relationship with Ethereum\nA true Ozempic L2 should show: - High migration of ETH native wallets - Strong L2 native user growth - Efficient fee generation that still provides meaningful revenue to Ethereum - Sustained or growing activity ratios over time\nWould you like me to elaborate on how we could implement the data collection for any of these metrics, or should we explore additional factors to consider in the scoring?\n\nNet Value Extraction Rate = (Value Bridged In - Value Bridged Out) / Total Time Period",

    "text": "6.10 Dependent Network Ratings\nPolygon zkEVM Settlement Guarantees (10/10 weight): Score: 9/10 The zkEVM uses zero-knowledge proofs to validate all state transitions. Every transaction batch includes a proof that mathematically demonstrates the correctness of all computations and state changes. These proofs are verified by Ethereum’s consensus mechanism, providing cryptographic certainty that state transitions are valid. This is nearly the highest level of settlement guarantee possible, just slightly below fully integrated L2s because of some optimizations in the proving system.\nDispute Resolution (9/10 weight): Score: 10/10 Ethereum serves as the absolute source of truth for the zkEVM. If there’s ever a dispute about the state, the zero-knowledge proofs verified by Ethereum’s consensus provide mathematical certainty about what is correct. There’s no dependency on fraud proofs or challenge periods - the cryptographic proofs mean disputes are resolved immediately and with absolute certainty by Ethereum.\nEconomic Security Inheritance (8/10 weight): Score: 9/10 The zkEVM inherits its fundamental security from Ethereum. The validity proofs mean it can’t confirm invalid state transitions, and its assets are secured by Ethereum’s consensus mechanism. While it has its own token (MATIC) for gas fees and other purposes, the core economic security - particularly for assets like ETH and tokens - comes directly from Ethereum.\nState Finality (7/10 weight): Score: 9/10 Once Ethereum confirms a zkEVM batch and its validity proof, that state is final with the same guarantees as Ethereum itself. The mathematical nature of the zero-knowledge proofs means there’s no waiting period for finality beyond Ethereum’s own finality period. This is as strong as state finality can get for a settlement-dependent network.\nExit Rights Guarantees (6/10 weight): Score: 8/10 Users can always withdraw their assets back to Ethereum by submitting a withdrawal request. These withdrawals are guaranteed by Ethereum’s consensus - once a withdrawal is proven valid through a ZK proof, no one can prevent the user from claiming their assets on Ethereum. The only limitation is the normal proving and processing time.\nState Progression Dependency (5/10 weight): Score: 7/10 While the zkEVM can process transactions independently, it can’t finalize new states without submitting proofs to Ethereum and having them verified. This creates a strong dependency on Ethereum for state progression, though there’s some independence in transaction processing.\nAsset Movement (4/10 weight): Score: 10/10 Native ETH and ERC-20 tokens can move seamlessly between Ethereum and the zkEVM. When assets move to the zkEVM, they’re locked on Ethereum and can only be unlocked through valid proofs. This provides the strongest possible guarantees for asset movement between the networks.\nTotal Score: 62/70 (approximately 89%)\nThis analysis places Polygon zkEVM firmly in the “Fully Non-Sovereign” category. Arbitrum Let me analyze Arbitrum’s relationship with Ethereum as a Settlement-Dependent Network by carefully examining each criterion. This will help us understand how optimistic rollups differ from ZK rollups in their settlement dependency.\nSettlement Guarantees (10/10 weight): Score: 7/10 Arbitrum uses an optimistic rollup design where transactions are assumed valid but can be challenged during a dispute period (currently 7 days). While this provides strong settlement guarantees, it’s not as immediate or mathematically certain as ZK rollups. The challenge period introduces a time-based element to settlement finality. However, the ability to prove fraud on Ethereum’s consensus layer still makes this a robust settlement mechanism.\nDispute Resolution (9/10 weight): Score: 8/10 Ethereum serves as the ultimate arbiter for Arbitrum through its fraud proof system. If someone identifies an invalid state transition, they can submit a fraud proof to Ethereum, which will automatically resolve the dispute and revert invalid transactions. This is strong dispute resolution, though not as immediate as ZK proofs since it requires active challengers and a challenge period. The key strength is that Ethereum’s consensus automatically enforces the correct resolution once fraud is proven.\nEconomic Security Inheritance (8/10 weight): Score: 9/10 Arbitrum inherits its fundamental security from Ethereum. The ability to prove fraud on Ethereum means that any attempt to corrupt Arbitrum’s state would require corrupting Ethereum itself. The sequencer role adds some centralization risk, but the fundamental economic security - particularly for assets - comes directly from Ethereum. Users can always force transactions through Ethereum if the sequencer fails.\nState Finality (7/10 weight): Score: 6/10 While Arbitrum’s state updates are recorded on Ethereum, true finality requires waiting through the challenge period. This creates a tradeoff between practical finality (which can be quite fast) and absolute finality (which requires waiting for the challenge period). This is lower than ZK rollups where finality is immediate once proofs are verified.\nExit Rights Guarantees (6/10 weight): Score: 8/10 Users can always withdraw their assets to Ethereum, guaranteed by Ethereum’s consensus. While withdrawals require waiting through the challenge period, they cannot be prevented by Arbitrum’s operators. The delay is longer than with ZK rollups, but the guarantee is just as strong once the period passes.\nState Progression Dependency (5/10 weight): Score: 7/10 Arbitrum can process transactions independently but must submit state roots to Ethereum for potential verification. While it has more processing independence than some systems, it ultimately depends on Ethereum for final state confirmation, especially during disputes.\nAsset Movement (4/10 weight): Score: 10/10 Native ETH and ERC-20 tokens move seamlessly between Ethereum and Arbitrum through a strong bridge mechanism backed by Ethereum’s consensus. When assets move to Arbitrum, they’re locked on Ethereum and can only be unlocked through valid withdrawals after the challenge period.\nTotal Score: 55/70 (approximately 79%)\nThis analysis places Arbitrum in the “Fully Non-Sovereign” category, though with a lower score than Polygon zkEVM. The main differences come from the challenge period required for absolute finality and the reliance on fraud proofs rather than validity proofs.\nStacks Settlement Guarantees (10/10 weight): Score: 4/10 Stacks uses Bitcoin for checkpointing and security anchoring However, it lacks cryptographic enforcement of settlement by Bitcoin’s consensus Bitcoin doesn’t automatically enforce or validate Stacks’ state transitions Falls into the “checkpoint systems” category rather than stronger settlement guarantees Dispute Resolution (9/10 weight): Score: 3/10 While Stacks records its state on Bitcoin, Bitcoin’s consensus doesn’t serve as the ultimate arbiter Disputes are primarily resolved within Stacks’ own consensus mechanism Bitcoin can’t automatically correct or resolve issues in Stacks’ state Economic Security Inheritance (8/10 weight): Score: 6/10 Miners must commit actual Bitcoin through PoX mechanism This creates some economic security dependency on Bitcoin However, Stacks maintains its own economic incentives through STX State Finality (7/10 weight): Score: 5/10 Stacks achieves finality through a combination of its own consensus and Bitcoin anchoring State is recorded on Bitcoin but not in a way that Bitcoin consensus enforces Provides stronger finality than fully independent chains but weaker than true L2s Exit Rights Guarantees (6/10 weight): Score: 4/10 With sBTC, users can move Bitcoin between chains However, this relies on Stacks’ mechanisms rather than being guaranteed by Bitcoin’s consensus Exit rights depend on threshold signatures rather than cryptographic guarantees State Progression Dependency (5/10 weight): Score: 7/10 Stacks blocks are linked to Bitcoin blocks through PoX State progression is tied to Bitcoin’s block progression However, Stacks can still process transactions independently within this framework Asset Movement (4/10 weight): Score: 5/10 sBTC enables Bitcoin movement between chains But this movement isn’t directly enforced by Bitcoin’s consensus Relies on threshold signatures and Stacks’ mechanisms Total Score: 34/59 (approximately 58%)\nThis places Stacks in the “Moderately Dependent” category on our spectrum.",

    "text": "6.11 Risks\nSub categories of risks include smart contract vulns regulatory risks centralization risks for CeDeFi and CEX’s MEV network level key and wallet compromise cross chain exploits oracle manipulation Social engineering exploitation of economic models Smart Contract Vulns Smart contract vulnerabilities represent one of the most critical risks in Web3, having led to billions in losses. This analysis examines major exploit categories based on historical hacks, their prevalence across different application models, and effective mitigation strategies.\nSubcategories are: Access Control Flaws Logic and Arithmetic Errors Oracle Manipulation Reentrancy attacks Flash Loan Vulnerabilities\nReentrancy attacks Mainly on Solidity. Famous example is the DAO hack which resulted in the Ethereum. pre 0.4.0 of Solidity there were no built in protections, so completely vulnerable.\nPre-0.4.0: No built-in protections, completely vulnerable 0.4.0-0.4.12: Introduction of the transfer() function with 2300 gas stipend, providing some protection but not comprehensive 0.4.13-0.7.x: Better compiler warnings about state changes after external calls 0.8.0+: Enhanced static analysis for potential reentrancy, but still requires explicit protection\nOpenZeppelin’s ReentrancyGuard became the gold standard for protecting against these attacks.\nMove, used by Sui and Aptos, takes a different approach. It uses a linear type system that treats resources as non-duplicatable assets. This makes traditional reentrancy attacks much harder because resources can’t be accessed multiple times in the same transaction. However, parallel execution in Sui could potentially create new forms of reentrancy-like vulnerabilities.\nHigh Risk (without additional protections): Solidity (EVM) - Requires explicit guards and careful external call handling Medium Risk: Cairo (StarkNet) - Possible but harder to accidentally create Cadence (Flow) - Resource model helps but inter-contract calls need attention Low Risk (by design): Move (Sui/Aptos) - Linear type system prevents traditional reentrancy Rust (Solana) - Execution model prevents traditional reentrancy Vyper (EVM) - Built-in restrictions prevent common reentrancy patterns Clarity (Stacks) - Decidability and no recursive calls prevent traditional reentrancy",

    "text": "9.2 Layer 2’s\nWe break these down into:\n\nRollups\n\nOptimistic\nZK\n\nValidiums\nPlasma\nSidechains\n\nSo Ethereum has chosen decentralization and security. This means Ethereum is shit at scaling.\nSo we need to talk about the theory of Layers in Blockchain\nThat’s why L2’s became a major part of the roadmap. How does the scalability limitation affect the network. Congestion and high gas fee’s. So people don’t interact on the chain and it hits a ceiling. So logically we should start any discussion with transaction fee’s, as that’s the direct result of the scalability failure and the main reason users use L2’s. Besides yield opportunities.\nSo we should first consider the Fee Markets on Ethereum and Bitcoin which are the two major chains looking to scale with L2’s. There is a lot of debate and a lot of misinformation around this topic.\nDependent networks can really be divided into chains: External DIN required to validate state transitions External DIN required to guarantee state transitions\nWe’ll define a framework for how we define a Dependent Network. There are few things we look at, in terms of priority: censorship resistance. Polygon zkEVM sequencer can censure, but you can go through the contract directly on Ethereum theoretically if censorship occurs. Same thing for Arbitrum. Although this is a very weak guarantee due to the complexity for regular users. For Stacks, it’s more censorship resistant that the other two. Also if I were to interact directly with the smart contract on Ethereum, that makes the L2’s pointless. Why do I need them if not to deal with congestion and high gas. dispute resolution. I believe all chains need to hard fork. Potentially not Movement due to Move’s resource model. None of the chains will automatically hard fork if a dispute is found. settlement. So the base chain must validate and guarantee state transitions on the dependent chain. This is kinda stupid. It’s guaranteeing the state transitions but makes no attempt to resolve things like censorship resistance. finality of settlement. Optimistic 7 days, zk 30 minutes, Stacks 16 hours economic security model inheritance - this is actually pointless as it just means the state transitions match the rules. Nothing about censorship resistance.\nSo my qualification of dependent networks means that they must inherit the censorship resistance of the base chain, settlement must be validated and guaranteed by the base chain, dispute resolution must be automatic and/or decentralized. else the chain can just fork.\nSettlement Types In order of strength Cryptographically enforced settlement Validity proofs Fraud proof systems Checkpoint systems\nCore Infrastructure Components Network Security Attack Vectors Network Level: Eclipse attacks, BGP hijacking, DDoS attacks Protocol Level: Double spending,

    "text": "2.2 Degen Slang\n\n2.2.1 HODL\nHODL originated as a misspelling of “hold” in a 2013 Bitcoin forum post titled “I AM HODLING.” The post’s author, frustrated by their poor trading performance during a Bitcoin price crash, declared they would simply hold onto their Bitcoin rather than try to time the market. The typographical error caught on as both a meme and an investment philosophy in the cryptocurrency community.\nThe term has evolved beyond its humorous origins to represent a long-term investment strategy often summarized as “Hold On for Dear Life.” This reflects the mindset of cryptocurrency investors who maintain their positions despite extreme market volatility, believing in the long-term value proposition of their assets rather than attempting to profit from short-term price movements.\nHODL also represents a rejection of traditional trading wisdom. While conventional financial markets emphasize technical analysis and market timing, HODLing suggests that, particularly in the volatile cryptocurrency space, a simple buy-and-hold strategy might outperform active trading for many investors. This approach acknowledges the difficulty of timing a highly volatile, 24/7 global market.\nThe term has become so influential that it helps identify different types of market participants. “HODLers” are often contrasted with “traders” or “speculators,” with HODLers viewed as providing market stability through their long-term commitment to holding assets. During market downturns, the community often encourages “HODL” as a way to maintain conviction and avoid panic selling.\nThe concept of HODLing has also influenced how blockchain projects design their token economics. Many projects now include staking mechanisms, vesting schedules, and other features that encourage long-term holding, showing how a simple misspelling has evolved into a fundamental aspect of cryptocurrency culture and economics.\n\n\n2.2.2 Degens\n“Degen” (short for “degenerate”) in crypto/Web3 culture refers to aggressive or risk-seeking participants in cryptocurrency markets and DeFi (decentralized finance) protocols. The term originated from gambling culture but has been embraced by the crypto community as a semi-ironic badge of honor.\n\nTrading Behavior: Degens are known for taking high-risk positions, often using significant leverage, and engaging in yield farming, liquidity mining, and other complex DeFi strategies.\nCultural Identity: Unlike traditional finance’s negative connotation of “degenerate gambling,” the crypto community has reclaimed “degen” as a positive or playful identifier. It represents a willingness to experiment with new protocols and take calculated risks.\nTechnical Sophistication: Despite the seeming recklessness implied by the term, many “degens” are highly knowledgeable about blockchain technology, smart contracts, and DeFi mechanics. They’re often early adopters of new protocols and technologies.\nCommunity Role: Degens play an important role in crypto ecosystems by providing early liquidity to new protocols, testing experimental features, and contributing to the rapid evolution of DeFi products.\n\n\n2.2.2.1 Blockchains\nThis chapter deals with the technical language of Web3.
