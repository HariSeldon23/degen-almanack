This is a crucial distinction because supporting multiple networks using the same model is fundamentally different from supporting multiple models. It’s generally a tradeoff between features and multi-model support. A wallet focusing on multi-model support generally needs to sacrifice resources that would be devoted to adding features. It’s a good rule of thumb, that a single model wallet will provide a better UX that a multi-model wallet. However as a degen, as you get more acquianted with DeFi you’ll be interacting with numerous chains with different models.",

    "text": "The genesis of this book was reading a technical argument on Twitter that was steeped in ideology. I agreed with both parties on certain points, yet the two combatants resorted to ad hominen attacks, both lacking a standardized framework in which to couch their arguments. This led me to rekindle an idea I’d had years before, to create a blockchain taxonomy. Something that would be easily accessible and would be able to be used to quickly dispel bad faith arguments.\nAfter building out the initial taxonomy, the breadth of the task started to dawn on me. The potential of it could be expanded to provide value not just to the technical community but to all parties interested in blockchain technology. I kept recalling the numerous conversations with family and friends asking for crypto investment advice. This wonderful patchwork of humanity I’ve had the fortune of spending my life with and how I could never give them an answer that spanned the breadth of this fascinating industry I love. Even sadder, I had no way of giving them advice concise enough for them to follow, that matched their investment goals.\nWhat then if there was a book, an Almanack for lack of a better word, that I could give to these people. A book that would educate, illuminate and help them make well informed investing decisions. While still straddling a fine line of being technically honest on how to safely navigate these waters.\nTaking a cue from history, following in the footsteps of Henry Vanrum Poor when he recognized the need for reliable information about the booming railroad companies. This takes inspiration from that venture with a modern twist. In line with the cypherpunk manifesto (Hughes 1993) and the open source communities(DiBona, Ockman, and Stone 1999) which I admire so much, this Almanack will be open source and community contributed. As a core tenet of the Cypherpunk manifesto, contributors identity will be less important than their reputation. The knowledge will be curated and go through an approval process via Github Pull Requests. The other innovation is that as the Alamack evolves over time it will integrate with real time data sources in order to provide a dynamic document that plugs into the market as it evolves.\nA brief note on the naming of the book. Initially I wanted to call it blockchain taxonomy, reflecting it’s early design goals. However as I worked more and more and it evolved into something much broader than a Taxonomy, Almanack made a lot more sense. Initially I liked Trollip’s Web3 Almanack. But all the broader terms for this industry have severe limitations. I consider myself a degen. And while it’s a loaded term, it’s being a degen that has armed me with the knowledge to attempt this ambitious venture. Hence Trollip’s Degen Almanack.\n\n\n\n\nDiBona, Chris, Sam Ockman, and Mark Stone. 1999. Open Sources: Voices from the Open Source Revolution.

    "text": "Web3\nWithin this Almanack we use the term Web3 rather than Crypto. While our industry is built on the back bone of cryptography, it encompasses not only a branch of mathematics, but economic, social, technological and political aspects. Web3 more closely aligns with the breadth of our industry.\nBelow you can see how the web has evolved into Web3.\n\n\n\nEvolution of the Web\n\n\n\nWeb1 (1990s): static websites, read-only content\nWeb2 (2000s - 2010s): Interactive social platforms, user-generated content\nWeb3 (2020s+): Decentralized networks, blockchain, user-owned data and assets\n\n\nDecentralization\n\n\n\nNetwork Topologies\n\n\n\n\n\nBlockchains\n\nLayer 1\nCurrently there is no formally and universally accepted definition of what comprises a L1 Network.\nWe have taken these sources in order to come up with our definition:\n\n(Nakamoto 2008) for Bitcoin\n(Buterin 2013) for Ethereum\n(Buterin 2021) for the rollups guide\n(Charbonneau 2023) for John’s excellent guide to rollups\n\nNakamoto’s Bitcoin whitepaper, while not explicitly using the term “Layer 1,” established the core principles of what we now recognize as Layer 1 characteristics: a base protocol that handles consensus, security, and data availability without relying on any other blockchain system. This introduced the concept of a self-contained, sovereign blockchain network.\nThe Ethereum whitepaper expanded this foundation by introducing programmability and demonstrating that a Layer 1 could be more than just a payment system. It showed that a Layer 1 blockchain serves as a foundation for broader computational capabilities while maintaining the core properties of decentralization and security.\nButerin’s rollup guide helps define Layer 1 by contrast - it clarifies what makes a base layer distinct from scaling solutions built on top of it. This work emphasizes that a Layer 1 blockchain must handle three critical functions: data availability, consensus, and execution, all while maintaining decentralization.\nCharbonneau’s report further refines our understanding by examining how Layer 1 blockchains interact with scaling solutions, highlighting their role as the security and settlement layer of the blockchain ecosystem.\nSynthesizing these sources, we can define a Layer 1 blockchain as:\nA sovereign blockchain network that provides three fundamental guarantees without relying on any other blockchain system:\n\nconsensus - the ability to agree on the state of the network\ndata availability - ensuring all transaction data is publicly accessible and verifiable\nexecution - the processing of transactions and state changes. It must do this while maintaining decentralization in its security model and serving as the ultimate settlement layer where the final state of all transactions is recorded.\n\n\nSettlement Layer\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLayer 2\nThere is no canonical definition of L2’s.\nWe use:\n\n(Gluchowski 2019)\n(Poon and Buterin 2017)\n(Poon and Dryja 2016)\n(Buterin 2021)\n(Charbonneau 2023)\n\nTo come up with the following Framework\n\nData Availability\n\n\nOn-chain (Rollups)\nOff-chain (Validiums, Plasma, Sidechains)\n\n\nSecurity Model\n\n\nInherited from L1 (Rollups, Validiums)\nIndependent (Sidechains)\nHybrid (Plasma)\n\n\nState Validation\n\n\nFraud Proofs (Optimistic Rollups)\nValidity Proofs (ZK Rollups, Validiums)\nIndependent (Sidechains)\nMerkle Roots (Plasma)\n\n\nSettlement Mechanism\n\n\nDirect (Rollups)\nChallenge Period (Optimistic Rollups)\nExit Games (Plasma)\nBridge/Peg (Sidechains)",

The term originated from gambling culture but has been embraced by the crypto community as a semi-ironic badge of honor.\n\nTrading Behavior: Degens are known for taking high-risk positions, often using significant leverage, and engaging in yield farming, liquidity mining, and other complex DeFi strategies.\nCultural Identity: Unlike traditional finance’s negative connotation of “degenerate gambling,” the crypto community has reclaimed “degen” as a positive or playful identifier. It represents a willingness to experiment with new protocols and take calculated risks.\nTechnical Sophistication: Despite the seeming recklessness implied by the term, many “degens” are highly knowledgeable about blockchain technology, smart contracts, and DeFi mechanics. They’re often early adopters of new protocols and technologies.\nCommunity Role: Degens play an important role in crypto ecosystems by providing early liquidity to new protocols, testing experimental features, and contributing to the rapid evolution of DeFi products.\n\n\n\nIntelligence\nThe “smol brain” to “gigabrain” progression in crypto represents the journey of understanding that many people go through in their crypto experience.\n\nSmol Brain\n\nBuys only the top trending coins on social media\n“Number go up” mentality\nPanic sells during dips\nFalls for obvious scams and rugpulls\nBelieves every “to the moon” prediction\nUses 100x leverage without understanding the risks\nThinks technical analysis is just drawing random lines\n\n\n\nMedium Brain\n\nLearns about market cycles\nStarts understanding blockchain basics\nDiscovers DeFi and yield farming\nGets into complex trading strategies\nOver-analyzes every chart pattern\nTries to time the market perfectly\nThinks they can outsmart the whales\n\n\n\nBig Brain\n\nUnderstands tokenomics\nReads whitepapers before investing\nUses risk management strategies\nRecognizes market manipulation tactics\nDevelops a long-term investment thesis\nLearns from past market cycles\nStudies blockchain technology deeply\n\n\n\nGigabrain\n\nReturns to simple but effective strategies\n“Time in the market beats timing the market”\nFocuses on fundamentals over hype\nUses basic DCA (Dollar Cost Averaging) strategy\nUnderstands that simplicity often wins\nDoesn’t chase every new trend\nHas learned emotional control\nCan explain complex concepts simply\nRecognizes that they can’t predict short-term movements\n\n\n\n\nCrypto characters\n\n\n\nWojak/NPC: Originally from 4chan, this simple face drawing represents the average retail trader who buys high and sells low. It’s often paired with the “feels guy” emotion variations, particularly during market crashes.\nSoyjak: a derogatory variation of Wojak used to mock people perceived as overly enthusiastic, naive, or conformist. The term combines “soy” (from the controversial and scientifically unsupported claim that soy consumption reduces masculinity) with “Wojak.”\nCoomer: a derogatory variation of Wojak used to mock people perceived as overly enthusiastic, naive, or conformist. The term combines “soy” (from the controversial and scientifically unsupported claim that soy consumption reduces masculinity) with “Wojak.”\nFUD (Fear, Uncertainty, Doubt): While not strictly a meme, it’s become memefied in crypto culture. Any negative news or criticism is often dismissed as “FUD” by cryptocurrency enthusiasts, sometimes ironically.\n“When Lambo?”: This phrase emerged during the 2017 bull run, representing the dream of getting rich enough from crypto to buy a Lamborghini. It’s both used seriously by newcomers and ironically by veterans.\nDiamond Hands / Paper Hands: Popularized during the GameStop saga but heavily adopted in crypto. “Diamond hands” refers to holders who don’t sell despite market pressure, while “paper hands” sell at the first sign of trouble.\n“This is good for Bitcoin”: Originally used seriously, it became ironic as people would claim any news, even negative, was somehow positive for Bitcoin’s adoption or price.\nBogdanoff Twins (“Dump It”): These memes feature the late Bogdanoff twins supposedly controlling the crypto markets, ordering price dumps right after someone buys or pumps after they sell.\n“Funds are SAFU”: From a Binance CEO video where he mispronounced “safe,” this became a way to reassure (often ironically) about exchange security. The “Have Fun Staying Poor” (HFSP): Used by crypto enthusiasts towards skeptics, though it’s increasingly used ironically, especially during bear markets.
