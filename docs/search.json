    "title": "Digital Independence",
    "section": "",
    "text": "The story of digital independence begins not with blockchains or cryptocurrencies, but with a profound recognition: the tools that brought unprecedented convenience to our lives have also created unprecedented control over them.\nConsider your daily financial life. Your morning coffee purchase creates a data point. Your salary arrives through systems you don’t control. Your savings exist primarily as numbers in someone else’s database. This convenience comes with hidden costs - your transactions can be blocked, your accounts frozen, your privacy compromised. Each small sacrifice of control seemed reasonable in isolation, but together they’ve created golden handcuffs of financial dependence.\nThis isn’t accidental. The post-industrial financial system runs on centralization because it’s efficient. Banks can process thousands of transactions per second. Credit cards work seamlessly across borders. Mobile payments happen with a fingerprint. But this efficiency masks a fundamental truth - you’re asking permission to use your own money.\nThe early cypherpunks understood this tradeoff. In 1993, Eric Hughes wrote in the Cypherpunk Manifesto:\n“Privacy is necessary for an open society in the electronic age. Privacy is not secrecy. A private matter is something one doesn’t want the whole world to know, but a secret matter is something one doesn’t want anybody to know. Privacy is the power to selectively reveal oneself to the world.”\nThey saw that digital privacy would become inseparable from freedom. Without privacy in our transactions and communications, true independence would be impossible. But they also understood that simply criticizing the system wasn’t enough - they needed to build alternatives.\nThis brings us to public key cryptography, the foundation of digital independence. Imagine having a special lock that anyone can use to send you messages or money, but only you can open. No permission needed, no middlemen required, no central authority to approve or deny. This isn’t just technical theory - it’s a practical tool for independence.\nBitcoin emerged from this foundation, but it would be a mistake to see it as just digital money. It proved that we could create systems where trust comes from mathematics and consensus rather than institutions. Where rules are enforced by code rather than policy. Where participation is permissionless rather than granted.\nThe path to digital independence isn’t about rejecting modern convenience - it’s about reclaiming control while preserving it. We’ll learn to:\n\nHold assets that can’t be frozen or seized\nCommunicate without surveillance\nTrade without gatekeepers\nBuild systems that resist control\n\nBut this power comes with responsibility. In traditional systems, mistakes can often be reversed. Passwords can be reset. Transactions can be disputed. In truly independent systems, you alone are responsible for your security. Your privacy. Your choices.\nThis Almanack exists because that responsibility requires knowledge. Not just technical knowledge, though that’s important, but practical wisdom. Understanding not just how these systems work, but why they matter. Learning not just to use tools, but to think independently about digital freedom.\nThe journey of digital independence is both personal and collective. Each person who takes control of their digital life strengthens the network for everyone. Each developer who builds privacy-preserving tools expands what’s possible. We’re not just users of a new system - we’re participants in its evolution.\nIn the coming chapters, we’ll explore both the philosophical foundations and practical tools of digital independence. Whether you’re a developer looking to build these systems or someone seeking to use them, understanding these foundations is essential. Because digital independence isn’t given - it’s learned, practiced, and ultimately, earned.\n\nStart with the philosophical and historical context - from cypherpunks to present\nExplain why both regular people and technologists seek alternatives to centralized systems\nCover the core principles: self-sovereignty, censorship resistance, trustless systems\nThis section unifies both audiences with common ground before diverging into specialized paths",

    "text": "Web3\nWhile our industry is built on the back bone of cryptography, it encompasses not only a branch of mathematics, but economic, social, technological and political aspects. Web3 more closely aligns with the breadth of our industry.\nBelow you can see how the web has evolved into Web3.\n\n\n\nEvolution of the Web\n\n\n\nWeb1 (1990s): static websites, read-only content\nWeb2 (2000s - 2010s): Interactive social platforms, user-generated content\nWeb3 (2020s+): Decentralized networks, blockchain, user-owned data and assets\n\n\n\nDecentralization\n\n\n\nNetwork Topologies\n\n\n\n\nBlockchains\n\nLayer 1\nCurrently there is no formally and universally accepted definition of what comprises a L1 Network.\nWe have taken these sources in order to come up with our definition:\n\n(Nakamoto 2008) for Bitcoin\n(Buterin 2013) for Ethereum\n(Buterin 2021) for the rollups guide\n(Charbonneau 2023) for John’s excellent guide to rollups\n\nNakamoto’s Bitcoin whitepaper, while not explicitly using the term “Layer 1,” established the core principles of what we now recognize as Layer 1 characteristics: a base protocol that handles consensus, security, and data availability without relying on any other blockchain system. This introduced the concept of a self-contained, sovereign blockchain network.\nThe Ethereum whitepaper expanded this foundation by introducing programmability and demonstrating that a Layer 1 could be more than just a payment system. It showed that a Layer 1 blockchain serves as a foundation for broader computational capabilities while maintaining the core properties of decentralization and security.\nButerin’s rollup guide helps define Layer 1 by contrast - it clarifies what makes a base layer distinct from scaling solutions built on top of it. This work emphasizes that a Layer 1 blockchain must handle three critical functions: data availability, consensus, and execution, all while maintaining decentralization.\nCharbonneau’s report further refines our understanding by examining how Layer 1 blockchains interact with scaling solutions, highlighting their role as the security and settlement layer of the blockchain ecosystem.\nSynthesizing these sources, we can define a Layer 1 blockchain as:\nA sovereign blockchain network that provides three fundamental guarantees without relying on any other blockchain system:\n\nconsensus - the ability to agree on the state of the network\ndata availability - ensuring all transaction data is publicly accessible and verifiable\nexecution - the processing of transactions and state changes. It must do this while maintaining decentralization in its security model and serving as the ultimate settlement layer where the final state of all transactions is recorded.\n\n\nSettlement Layer\nThis is kinda a meme at this point and no formal definition exists. Although lots of opinions, as is generally the case in crypto.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLayer 2\nThere is no canonical definition of L2’s.\nWe use:\n\nzkRollup vs Optimistic Rollup (Gluchowski 2019)\nPlasma (Poon and Buterin 2017)\nThe Bitcoin Lightning Network (Poon and Dryja 2016)\nIncomplete Guide to Rollups (Buterin 2021)\nThe Complete Guide to Rollups (Charbonneau 2023)\n\nTo come up with the following Framework\n\nData Availability\n\n\nOn-chain (Rollups)\nOff-chain (Validiums, Plasma, Sidechains)\n\n\nSecurity Model\n\n\nInherited from L1 (Rollups, Validiums)\nIndependent (Sidechains)\nHybrid (Plasma)\n\n\nState Validation\n\n\nFraud Proofs (Optimistic Rollups)\nValidity Proofs (ZK Rollups, Validiums)\nIndependent (Sidechains)\nMerkle Roots (Plasma)\n\n\nSettlement Mechanism\n\n\nDirect (Rollups)\nChallenge Period (Optimistic Rollups)\nExit Games (Plasma)\nBridge/Peg (Sidechains)",

We define an Account as a user owned blockchain public-private key pair. The account can be a simple account that can only send Coins or execute smart contracts, or the Account can be a smart account, whereby it’s behaviour and attributes can be controlled by code.\nPlease note a user can be either a human, bot, or AI agent.\n\nSeed phrases\nIn order to create an Account on a blockchain, it needs to be secured by a public-private key pair. The most common way to do is via a Seed phrase generated by the wallet.\nSince your private key is the singular point of security for your interaction on that blockchain, it needs to be incredibly secure. This means that your private key is a very large random number. Due to the difficulty of working with these large random numbers, Seed phrases were created to improve the user experience. Historically humans have used “code words” to obfuscate and hide meaning. Seed phrases are just a way to generate a private key in a more human relatable way.\n\n\nSimple Account\nIn the early days of blockchain, while only Proof of Work blockchains existed, an account was simply a public-private key pair that could transfer Coins or execute a very simple script.\nWith the advent of Ethereum, Accounts and Blockchains became more powerful. In Ethereum’s Yellow Paper (Wood 2014) Gavin Wood introduced the concept of an Externally Owned Account, or EOA for short.\nThere it is defined as:\n\nHaving a nonce (counter for transactions sent)\nHaving a balance (in the native currency)\nNo associated contract code\nNo data storage\n\nNow that we have the rise of different Application models we need to further refine what a Simple Account is:\n\nDirect control through a public-private key pair\nNo additional programmable logic at the account level\nTransactions must be directly signed by the controlling private key",

This Almanack can and will use data from any trusted source. But in the early days while we require data specifically tailored to our requirements, we will be using Ortege. Anyone contributing however can integrate with any other reputable data sources.\nWe break down API’s into the following categories:\n\nRPC Nodes. These are the API’s provided by the Blockchain clients. Each Application Model will have a different API structure. The most famous example being the Bitcon RPC standard and the EVM RPC standard\nSQL based. These API’s allow you to write SQL against their Datasets. Examples include Dune and Flipside. Much like the RPC based API’s, these will all have a different API structure.\nSemantic Layer. Ortege is the first, that I’m aware of, API that aims to abstract away the blockchains implementation away from the developer and provide a uniform API that is consistent across blockchains.\n\n\nOrtege\nComing Soon.",

    "text": "Not your keys, not your Coins\n“Not your keys, not your coins” is one of the most fundamental principles in cryptocurrency, emerging from the early days of Bitcoin and becoming even more relevant after several high-profile exchange failures. This phrase encapsulates a core tenet of cryptocurrency’s original vision: true financial self-custody.\nThe principle is simple but profound: if you don’t control the private keys to your cryptocurrency wallet, you don’t truly own your cryptocurrency. When you keep your crypto on an exchange or any centralized platform, you’re essentially trusting that entity with your assets. The exchange provides you with an IOU - a promise that they’re holding your coins safely - rather than giving you direct control over them. This arrangement mirrors traditional banking, where your money is actually a liability on the bank’s balance sheet rather than physical cash in your possession.\nThe significance of this principle has been repeatedly demonstrated through catastrophic exchange failures like Mt. Gox, FTX, and others, where users lost billions because they trusted centralized entities with their crypto assets. Each of these events reinforced the wisdom of the original crypto ethos: the only way to truly own your cryptocurrency is to hold your private keys in a wallet you control. This might mean using a hardware wallet, a properly secured software wallet, or even a paper wallet, but the key factor is that you - and only you - have access to the private keys that control the funds.\nThis phrase has evolved from a simple security recommendation into a battle cry for cryptocurrency self-sovereignty, encouraging users to take direct responsibility for their assets rather than defaulting to the familiar but potentially risky comfort of centralized custody. It represents not just a practical security measure, but a philosophical alignment with the decentralized, trustless principles that cryptocurrency was built upon.",

    "text": "HODL\nHODL originated as a misspelling of “hold” in a 2013 Bitcoin forum post titled “I AM HODLING.” The post’s author, frustrated by their poor trading performance during a Bitcoin price crash, declared they would simply hold onto their Bitcoin rather than try to time the market. The typographical error caught on as both a meme and an investment philosophy in the cryptocurrency community.\nThe term has evolved beyond its humorous origins to represent a long-term investment strategy often summarized as “Hold On for Dear Life.” This reflects the mindset of cryptocurrency investors who maintain their positions despite extreme market volatility, believing in the long-term value proposition of their assets rather than attempting to profit from short-term price movements.\nHODL also represents a rejection of traditional trading wisdom. While conventional financial markets emphasize technical analysis and market timing, HODLing suggests that, particularly in the volatile cryptocurrency space, a simple buy-and-hold strategy might outperform active trading for many investors. This approach acknowledges the difficulty of timing a highly volatile, 24/7 global market.\nThe term has become so influential that it helps identify different types of market participants. “HODLers” are often contrasted with “traders” or “speculators,” with HODLers viewed as providing market stability through their long-term commitment to holding assets. During market downturns, the community often encourages “HODL” as a way to maintain conviction and avoid panic selling.\nThe concept of HODLing has also influenced how blockchain projects design their token economics. Many projects now include staking mechanisms, vesting schedules, and other features that encourage long-term holding, showing how a simple misspelling has evolved into a fundamental aspect of cryptocurrency culture and economics.",

His journey began as a curious teenager writing for Bitcoin Magazine, where he first explored the limitations of Bitcoin’s scripting language. This exploration led him to envision a more programmable blockchain platform that could serve as a global computer.\nIn 2013, Buterin published the Ethereum whitepaper, introducing the revolutionary concept of a blockchain platform that could execute arbitrary code through “smart contracts.” This innovation transformed blockchain technology from a purely financial tool into a general-purpose computing platform, enabling everything from decentralized applications (dApps) to non-fungible tokens (NFTs).\nKnown for his profound technical insights and philosophical writings, Buterin continues to shape Ethereum’s development through research into scaling solutions like sharding and rollups. His advocacy for “crypto for social good” has influenced numerous humanitarian blockchain projects, while his vocal support for proof-of-stake helped drive Ethereum’s successful transition from proof-of-work in The Merge.\nDespite his prominence, Buterin maintains a reputation for intellectual humility and openness to criticism. He regularly publishes detailed technical analyses on his blog, addressing everything from blockchain scalability to social coordination problems. His commitment to open discourse and technical excellence has earned him respect even from competing blockchain communities.",

    "text": "Private Key Management\nA large part of the early vision of crypto was to create a currency with the absence of a central authority (read Government). Indeed the first Bitcoin block, mined by Satoshi contained a message admonishing the banks.\nIn order to have a currency not controlled by a central authority, you need to be able to exchange value with others while not relying on the authority of governments. If I give you 10 digital dollars, what’s to prevent you from saying you never received it? Who proves the exchange occured? This is where Cryptography comes into it. We won’t go into the technical details here, it’s just important to note some general overview.\nYour account/wallet on a blockchain is secured by a public-private key pair. You can think of the public key as akin to an email address and the private key as your password. Whenever you create a wallet and a seed phrase is generated, what’s essentially happening is a public-private key is being generated.\nNow whenever you interact with a blockchain, for example by sending someone some digital coins, you need to sign that transaction. What you’re doing is essentially using your private key to sign that you do want to perform that transaction.\nThis is why keeping your private key safe is the most important thing you can do in Web3. Since we have no trusted authority, we can only rely on ourselves in this decentralized environment. If someone got access to your private key, they would be able to do anything with the assets that are owned by your account.\nThe below are the ways you can store your private key or seed phrases:\nFor newcomers, we recommend cold storage via using a Hardware wallet. However this is impractical for a few reasons:\nFor this reason we recommend using Passkeys however this is only beginning to see adoption in Web3 and is not quite ready for mass adoption at this stage. Please see creating your first crypto wallet for the latest recommendation.",

Where a position is required, we’ll take one.\nThe North Star of this Almanack is financial independence. All strategies will be tailored to help you achieve this.\nI’m a firm believer in Compound Interest. While as we progress up the degeneracy scale we’ll be trading shit coins like a drunken Goth invading Italy, for now we want to learn some fundamentals, which we can then ignore later at our peril.\n\n“Compound Interest is the eighth wonder of the world. He who understands it, earns it; he who doesn’t, pays it” - Often misattributed, but Author unknown\n\nThis isn’t a TardFi textbook, so I’m not going too deeply into Compound Interest. I much prefer the Future Value of Money.\n\n“If you don’t know where you are going, you’ll end up someplace else.” - Yogi Berra\n\nSo where are we going? Financial Independence from a Central Authority. That’s what I want, and I’m pretty sure if you’re reading this, you want it too.\nSo this book will be tailored to the people living in the third world. So if you live in the first world, just add an extra zero to all the figures and follow along. But for someone living in the third world where they need to live on $7 a day to survive, in order to get financial freedom from a central authority, they’d need to earn enough interest on their money yearly to afford their daily survival. So that’s approximately $2,555 US dollars they’d need to earn in interest yearly. This would need to be a relatively stable yield without crazy degen high risks. So something like a US Bond. We’ll get into that later.\nBut let’s say we can get 4% yearly. That means we need a principal of $63,875 in order to escape reliance on any authority.\nSo now we know where we’re going.\nHow do we get there?\nIn this example, we’re going to ignore things like inflation for the time being. Even though inflation is one of the major driving forces behind crypto adoption.\nThe formula for future value with periodic payments is: FV = PV × (1 + r)^n + PMT × [((1 + r)^n - 1) / r] Where:\n\nFV = Future Value\nPV = Present Value (initial investment)\nPMT = Payment (the regular contribution amount)\nr = Interest rate (as a decimal)\nn = Number of time periods\n\nInteractive Financial Independence Calculator\nUse the calculator below to experiment with different scenarios and see how they affect your path to financial independence.

    "text": "Shit Coins\nDeFi truly started on Ethereum in DeFi Summer 2020.\nSome pedants will argue it started in 2016, with the launch of EtherDelta and the 2017 ICO boom where it handled about 10% of all Ethereum token trading volume. But degen DeFi started in 2020 with the most degen of crazes. Food tokens and farming.\nMeme coins had started in 2013 with Doge. However in the early days even the worst shit coins had to have a network. So even the scammers needed to have enough technical proficiency to create a network to issue a token to scam you. That changed with the advent of the ERC20 token standard on Ethereum in late 2015. Now scammers and purveyors of shit coins could just copy and paste some code and voila, shit coin!\nScammers everywhere rejoiced.\nIn 2020 when DeFi Summer started kicking off, we got a flood of that special brand of shit coin, the Governance token. We can probably blame MakerDAO for this atrocity, with the introduction of “Liquidity Mining” or “Yield Farming”. You see, shit coin creators crave liquidity above all else. Without liquidity, they cannot dump on the market. Without liquidity, you cannot manipulate the market to think your shit coin is worth billions. Traditionally shit coin creators had to go to CEX’s to get liquidity. The problem is CEX’s are just as, if not more, crooked than shit coin creators. CEX’s charge astronomical prices to list. And then they dump on the market before the shit coin creator can. For a great case study see how $GALA shat the bed after getting listed on that dodgiest of the dodge, FTX.\nSo Yield Farming allowed shit coin creators a new way to gain liquidity and if anything better PsyOps for dumping on mid brains. What you do is, you create your shit coin, with a massive supply, think billions. Then you allocate 10% of this token supply for Yield Farming. Now liquidity on CEX’s are provided by mature market makers. Retail is excluded as they’re not mature enough or have the resources to provide market making services. So since Uniswap provided an easy way for retail (read marks) to provide liquidity, you could offer these gullible people rewards for providing liquidity. So let’s say you put in $10 of liquidity, you’d offer these users $10 a month in Yield Farming rewards for that liquidity. Easy money for the mark. Except that $10 a month is in the shit coin. Shit coin creator gets liquidity so they can dump their allocation into Stables or a blue chip Coin. Farming Yields go to shit. YOU get rekt. Unlucky.\nSo now we have all the ingredients for a Yield Farming.\nWelcome to DeFi Summer 2020.\nThere were also some cool examples of Vampire Attacks. Or more broadly, a protocol ripping off the source code of a naive project, wrapping a token around their stolen work and trying to unfairly profit. How very James Taggart of them.\nSo first lesson, we don’t deal with shit coins.

Being online 24/7 during bull markets is going to make you stupid, strung out and will ensure your strategies are riddled with mistakes. Being a balanced person will make you way more money than some sleep deprived, Twitter obsessed doos. Let the machines work for you.\nSo we need a good notification system. We can use:\n\nTenderly Web3 Actions, or\nOpenZeppelin Defender Sentinels\n\nWe’ll use Tenderly’s Web3 actions as they’re more flexible and powerful. Since we’ll be using Ethena’s USDe quite alot through this strategies it’s important that if it shits the bed, we can get out quickly before losing everything. As an example UST on May 10th 2022 from holding it’s dollar peg to losing half it’s value in about 38 hours. So if USDe loses more than 10%, we must assume a death spiral and get our money out.\n!UST depeg\nSo what we want to do is to go to CoinGecko and find the biggest amount of on chain liquidity for USDe. So find USDe and then go to Markets to find the on DEX with the biggest depth. Currently that’s Uniswap V3 with a USDE/USDT pool on Ethereum. https://app.uniswap.org/explore/pools/ethereum/0x435664008F38B0650fBC1C9fc971D0A3Bc2f1e47\nSo we can set a notification for event emitted in Tenderly through the UI. However this doesn’t give us the exchange rate. So it’s good enough for now, but we’ll eventually revise this to have common notifications that will apply across all our strategies.",

A means of exchange that has been working just fine for centuries. Cash is private by default and people have seemed pretty happy with that arrangement for over 3 centuries.\nThe hardest part of ensuring privacy is making sure that when you create a new wallet there is no trace back to your off chain identity.\nThe two biggest footprints you can leave are:\nWhen funding your on chain wallet from a CEX, it becomes very easy to trace your identity. Almost all CEX’s require you to KYC. So when you transfer $10 of ETH into your Metamask wallet, anyone will be able to find out that the funding of the wallet came from a CEX and via the CEX will be able to link your identity to your wallet.\nSo currently the best way to do this is:\nWe can also try Railgun.

    "text": "Dependent Network Ratings\nPolygon zkEVM Settlement Guarantees (10/10 weight): Score: 9/10 The zkEVM uses zero-knowledge proofs to validate all state transitions. Every transaction batch includes a proof that mathematically demonstrates the correctness of all computations and state changes. These proofs are verified by Ethereum’s consensus mechanism, providing cryptographic certainty that state transitions are valid. This is nearly the highest level of settlement guarantee possible, just slightly below fully integrated L2s because of some optimizations in the proving system.\nDispute Resolution (9/10 weight): Score: 10/10 Ethereum serves as the absolute source of truth for the zkEVM. If there’s ever a dispute about the state, the zero-knowledge proofs verified by Ethereum’s consensus provide mathematical certainty about what is correct. There’s no dependency on fraud proofs or challenge periods - the cryptographic proofs mean disputes are resolved immediately and with absolute certainty by Ethereum.\nEconomic Security Inheritance (8/10 weight): Score: 9/10 The zkEVM inherits its fundamental security from Ethereum. The validity proofs mean it can’t confirm invalid state transitions, and its assets are secured by Ethereum’s consensus mechanism. While it has its own token (MATIC) for gas fees and other purposes, the core economic security - particularly for assets like ETH and tokens - comes directly from Ethereum.\nState Finality (7/10 weight): Score: 9/10 Once Ethereum confirms a zkEVM batch and its validity proof, that state is final with the same guarantees as Ethereum itself. The mathematical nature of the zero-knowledge proofs means there’s no waiting period for finality beyond Ethereum’s own finality period. This is as strong as state finality can get for a settlement-dependent network.\nExit Rights Guarantees (6/10 weight): Score: 8/10 Users can always withdraw their assets back to Ethereum by submitting a withdrawal request. These withdrawals are guaranteed by Ethereum’s consensus - once a withdrawal is proven valid through a ZK proof, no one can prevent the user from claiming their assets on Ethereum. The only limitation is the normal proving and processing time.\nState Progression Dependency (5/10 weight): Score: 7/10 While the zkEVM can process transactions independently, it can’t finalize new states without submitting proofs to Ethereum and having them verified. This creates a strong dependency on Ethereum for state progression, though there’s some independence in transaction processing.\nAsset Movement (4/10 weight): Score: 10/10 Native ETH and ERC-20 tokens can move seamlessly between Ethereum and the zkEVM. When assets move to the zkEVM, they’re locked on Ethereum and can only be unlocked through valid proofs. This provides the strongest possible guarantees for asset movement between the networks.\nTotal Score: 62/70 (approximately 89%)\nThis analysis places Polygon zkEVM firmly in the “Fully Non-Sovereign” category. Arbitrum Let me analyze Arbitrum’s relationship with Ethereum as a Settlement-Dependent Network by carefully examining each criterion. This will help us understand how optimistic rollups differ from ZK rollups in their settlement dependency.\nSettlement Guarantees (10/10 weight): Score: 7/10 Arbitrum uses an optimistic rollup design where transactions are assumed valid but can be challenged during a dispute period (currently 7 days). While this provides strong settlement guarantees, it’s not as immediate or mathematically certain as ZK rollups. The challenge period introduces a time-based element to settlement finality. However, the ability to prove fraud on Ethereum’s consensus layer still makes this a robust settlement mechanism.\nDispute Resolution (9/10 weight): Score: 8/10 Ethereum serves as the ultimate arbiter for Arbitrum through its fraud proof system. If someone identifies an invalid state transition, they can submit a fraud proof to Ethereum, which will automatically resolve the dispute and revert invalid transactions. This is strong dispute resolution, though not as immediate as ZK proofs since it requires active challengers and a challenge period. The key strength is that Ethereum’s consensus automatically enforces the correct resolution once fraud is proven.\nEconomic Security Inheritance (8/10 weight): Score: 9/10 Arbitrum inherits its fundamental security from Ethereum. The ability to prove fraud on Ethereum means that any attempt to corrupt Arbitrum’s state would require corrupting Ethereum itself. The sequencer role adds some centralization risk, but the fundamental economic security - particularly for assets - comes directly from Ethereum. Users can always force transactions through Ethereum if the sequencer fails.\nState Finality (7/10 weight): Score: 6/10 While Arbitrum’s state updates are recorded on Ethereum, true finality requires waiting through the challenge period. This creates a tradeoff between practical finality (which can be quite fast) and absolute finality (which requires waiting for the challenge period). This is lower than ZK rollups where finality is immediate once proofs are verified.\nExit Rights Guarantees (6/10 weight): Score: 8/10 Users can always withdraw their assets to Ethereum, guaranteed by Ethereum’s consensus. While withdrawals require waiting through the challenge period, they cannot be prevented by Arbitrum’s operators. The delay is longer than with ZK rollups, but the guarantee is just as strong once the period passes.\nState Progression Dependency (5/10 weight): Score: 7/10 Arbitrum can process transactions independently but must submit state roots to Ethereum for potential verification. While it has more processing independence than some systems, it ultimately depends on Ethereum for final state confirmation, especially during disputes.\nAsset Movement (4/10 weight): Score: 10/10 Native ETH and ERC-20 tokens move seamlessly between Ethereum and Arbitrum through a strong bridge mechanism backed by Ethereum’s consensus. When assets move to Arbitrum, they’re locked on Ethereum and can only be unlocked through valid withdrawals after the challenge period.\nTotal Score: 55/70 (approximately 79%)\nThis analysis places Arbitrum in the “Fully Non-Sovereign” category, though with a lower score than Polygon zkEVM. The main differences come from the challenge period required for absolute finality and the reliance on fraud proofs rather than validity proofs.\nStacks Settlement Guarantees (10/10 weight): Score: 4/10 Stacks uses Bitcoin for checkpointing and security anchoring However, it lacks cryptographic enforcement of settlement by Bitcoin’s consensus Bitcoin doesn’t automatically enforce or validate Stacks’ state transitions Falls into the “checkpoint systems” category rather than stronger settlement guarantees Dispute Resolution (9/10 weight): Score: 3/10 While Stacks records its state on Bitcoin, Bitcoin’s consensus doesn’t serve as the ultimate arbiter Disputes are primarily resolved within Stacks’ own consensus mechanism Bitcoin can’t automatically correct or resolve issues in Stacks’ state Economic Security Inheritance (8/10 weight): Score: 6/10 Miners must commit actual Bitcoin through PoX mechanism This creates some economic security dependency on Bitcoin However, Stacks maintains its own economic incentives through STX State Finality (7/10 weight): Score: 5/10 Stacks achieves finality through a combination of its own consensus and Bitcoin anchoring State is recorded on Bitcoin but not in a way that Bitcoin consensus enforces Provides stronger finality than fully independent chains but weaker than true L2s Exit Rights Guarantees (6/10 weight): Score: 4/10 With sBTC, users can move Bitcoin between chains However, this relies on Stacks’ mechanisms rather than being guaranteed by Bitcoin’s consensus Exit rights depend on threshold signatures rather than cryptographic guarantees State Progression Dependency (5/10 weight): Score: 7/10 Stacks blocks are linked to Bitcoin blocks through PoX State progression is tied to Bitcoin’s block progression However, Stacks can still process transactions independently within this framework Asset Movement (4/10 weight): Score: 5/10 sBTC enables Bitcoin movement between chains But this movement isn’t directly enforced by Bitcoin’s consensus Relies on threshold signatures and Stacks’ mechanisms Total Score: 34/59 (approximately 58%)\nThis places Stacks in the “Moderately Dependent” category on our spectrum.",

    "text": "BTC\nBitcoin has emerged as the world’s first successful digital store of value, creating a new paradigm for wealth preservation in the digital age. Much like gold served ancient civilizations through to modern times as a reliable store of wealth, Bitcoin provides similar characteristics but with distinct advantages native to the digital realm.\nAt its foundation, Bitcoin’s value proposition rests on its absolute scarcity - there will never be more than 21 million bitcoins. This hard cap, combined with a transparent and immutable issuance schedule through mining “halvings” every four years, creates a predictability that even gold, with its uncertain mining output, cannot match. When new gold deposits are discovered or mining technology improves, supply can increase unexpectedly. Bitcoin’s supply schedule, in contrast, is mathematically certain.\nBitcoin’s digital nature offers significant advantages over traditional stores of value. Unlike gold, it can be transferred instantly across borders, divided into microscopic units, stored without physical vault costs, and verified for authenticity without specialized equipment. Its self-custody properties allow individuals to maintain direct control over their wealth without relying on third-party custodians or financial institutions.\nThe network’s security model, backed by massive computational power through proof-of-work mining, has proven remarkably resilient over more than a decade. This track record has gradually built confidence among institutional investors, who increasingly view Bitcoin as a legitimate asset class for portfolio diversification and inflation hedging. Major financial institutions now offer Bitcoin investment products, while some corporations have adopted it as a treasury reserve asset.\nWhile Bitcoin began as a peer-to-peer electronic cash system, its evolution into a store of value mirrors how gold transformed from a medium of exchange into a wealth preservation tool. The emergence of Layer 2 solutions like the Lightning Network now handles Bitcoin’s payments functionality, allowing the base layer to focus on its primary role as digital gold - the foundational layer of monetary security in the cryptocurrency ecosystem.",

It functions as an institutional-grade wrapped version of Bitcoin, backed 1:1 by actual Bitcoin held in Coinbase’s custody. What makes cbBTC particularly noteworthy is its institutional focus, leveraging Coinbase’s reputation as a publicly traded company and its robust custody infrastructure to provide a secure and regulated way to use Bitcoin across different blockchain ecosystems.\nThe technical architecture of cbBTC operates through a burn-and-mint mechanism on the Base network, Coinbase’s layer-2 blockchain built on top of Ethereum. When users deposit Bitcoin into Coinbase’s custody, an equivalent amount of cbBTC is minted on Base. This process allows Bitcoin holders to participate in Base’s growing DeFi ecosystem while maintaining exposure to Bitcoin’s value. The token implements additional security measures, including proof of reserves and regular audits, making it particularly appealing to institutional investors who require high levels of security and regulatory compliance. Unlike some other wrapped Bitcoin tokens, cbBTC’s key differentiator is its direct integration with Coinbase’s established infrastructure and its focus on institutional-grade security and compliance measures.",

    "text": "ETH\nEthereum represents a revolutionary leap in computing - it’s humanity’s first attempt at creating a global, decentralized computer that’s always running and accessible to everyone. Like how the internet connected computers worldwide for information sharing, Ethereum connects computers globally to create a single, unified computational platform that no one controls but everyone can use.\nThink of Ethereum as a massive, worldwide computer with some unique properties: it never shuts down, can’t be censored, and maintains perfect records of everything it processes. Instead of storing photos or documents like a regular computer, this world computer specializes in running smart contracts - pieces of code that automatically execute agreements and handle digital assets without needing intermediaries.\nETH, the network’s native asset, serves as the essential “fuel” that powers this world computer. Every computation, whether it’s processing a DeFi trade or minting an NFT, requires ETH to run. After Ethereum’s transition to Proof of Stake through The Merge, ETH also gained a new role - network validators must stake ETH to participate in securing the network, similar to how a computer needs electricity to function and stay secure.\nWhat makes Ethereum truly revolutionary is its programmability. Just as early personal computers transformed from specialized calculators into general-purpose machines that could run any software, Ethereum evolved blockchain technology from a simple transaction ledger into a platform that can run any programmable application. This has spawned entire new industries: decentralized finance (DeFi) protocols that operate 24/7 without human intervention, NFT marketplaces that enable digital ownership and royalties, and DAOs that coordinate human activity through code rather than hierarchies.\nThe platform continues to evolve through ambitious technical upgrades. Layer 2 scaling solutions like rollups act as specialized processors that handle heavy computations off the main chain, while the planned implementation of sharding will divide the network into parallel processing units - similar to how modern computers use multiple cores to increase performance. These improvements aim to make the world computer more efficient and accessible while maintaining its core properties of decentralization and security.\nAs this world computer grows in capability and adoption, ETH’s value proposition strengthens - it’s not just a digital asset, but the essential resource needed to access and use what might become the foundation of our digital future.",

    "text": "Asymetric Cryptography\nPublic Key Cryptography\nRSA and elliptic curve cryptography. Slow than symetric cryptography. Enables secure communication over insecure channels\n\nPasskeys\nThink of passkeys as a modern, more secure replacement for passwords. Instead of remembering complex strings of characters, your device creates and stores a pair of mathematically linked keys - one public and one private. This system is built on public key cryptography, which has been proven secure over decades of use. Here’s how the process works, step by step: When you first set up a passkey with a website or app:\n\nYour device generates two mathematical keys: a private key that stays securely stored on your device, and a public key that gets sent to the service you’re signing up with. The private key never leaves your device - this is crucial for security.\nThe service stores your public key along with your account information. Think of the public key as a special lock that can only be opened by your private key.\n\nWhen you later want to sign in:\n\nThe service sends your device a random mathematical challenge - imagine it as a complex puzzle.\nYour device uses your private key to solve this puzzle in a way that proves you have the correct private key, without actually revealing the key itself.\nThe service verifies the solution using your stored public key. If it matches, you’re granted access.\n\nWhat makes this particularly clever is the biometric integration. Your device typically requires your fingerprint, face scan, or PIN before it will use the private key. This adds an extra layer of security - even if someone stole your device, they couldn’t use your passkeys without your biometric data. The system also handles synchronization elegantly. If you’re using an ecosystem like Apple or Google, your encrypted passkeys can sync across your devices. When you want to log in on a new device, your phone can help authenticate you by displaying a QR code that creates a secure connection between devices. To make this more concrete, imagine you’re signing into a banking app:\nYou open the app and enter your username Instead of asking for a password, the app sends a challenge to your phone Your phone asks you to verify with your fingerprint Once verified, your phone uses your private key to respond to the challenge The bank verifies this response and logs you in\nAll of this happens in seconds, and it’s much more secure than traditional passwords because:\nThe private key never travels across the internet Each login uses a different challenge, so responses can’t be reused by attackers Biometric verification adds an extra security layer The cryptographic math behind it is extremely difficult to break",

This means Ethereum is shit at scaling.\nSo we need to talk about the theory of Layers in Blockchain\nThat’s why L2’s became a major part of the roadmap. How does the scalability limitation affect the network. Congestion and high gas fee’s. So people don’t interact on the chain and it hits a ceiling. So logically we should start any discussion with transaction fee’s, as that’s the direct result of the scalability failure and the main reason users use L2’s. Besides yield opportunities.\nSo we should first consider the Fee Markets on Ethereum and Bitcoin which are the two major chains looking to scale with L2’s. There is a lot of debate and a lot of misinformation around this topic.\nDependent networks can really be divided into chains: External DIN required to validate state transitions External DIN required to guarantee state transitions\nWe’ll define a framework for how we define a Dependent Network. There are few things we look at, in terms of priority:\n\ncensorship resistance. Polygon zkEVM sequencer can censure, but you can go through the contract directly on Ethereum theoretically if censorship occurs. Same thing for Arbitrum. Although this is a very weak guarantee due to the complexity for regular users. For Stacks, it’s more censorship resistant that the other two. Also if I were to interact directly with the smart contract on Ethereum, that makes the L2’s pointless. Why do I need them if not to deal with congestion and high gas. dispute resolution. I believe all chains need to hard fork. Potentially not Movement due to Move’s resource model. None of the chains will automatically hard fork if a dispute is found.\nsettlement. So the base chain must validate and guarantee state transitions on the dependent chain. This is kinda stupid. It’s guaranteeing the state transitions but makes no attempt to resolve things like censorship resistance.\nfinality of settlement. Optimistic 7 days, zk 30 minutes, Stacks 16 hours\neconomic security model inheritance - this is actually pointless as it just means the state transitions match the rules. Nothing about censorship resistance.\n\nSo my qualification of dependent networks means that they must inherit the censorship resistance of the base chain, settlement must be validated and guaranteed by the base chain, dispute resolution must be automatic and/or decentralized. else the chain can just fork.\nSettlement Types In order of strength\n\nCryptographically enforced settlement\nValidity proofs\nFraud proof systems\nCheckpoint systems",

Judicial is where it gets challenging. This is pretty much the entire community. People interpret rules by economic activity and nodes. Look at Bitcoin Cash. No money. So everyone agreed with the block size of Bitcoin.\nThere is also the concept of Canvassing or Lobbying can also occur. Let’s look at Ethereum. If I wanted to increase the gas limit from 30 million to 31 million. I’d need to canvas all the nodes to come along with me. Currently there is 5,333 nodes.

Soft Forks\n\nDefinition: Backwards-compatible protocol changes that tighten rules without invalidating existing blocks\nCharacteristics:\n\nBackwards compatible\nOld nodes can still participate (with limitations)\nLower coordination requirements\n\nUse Cases: Adding new features, incremental improvements\nExamples: Bitcoin’s P2SH implementation, taproot upgrade\n\n\n\n3.
