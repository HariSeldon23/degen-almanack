    "text": "The cryptocurrency revolution has created unprecedented opportunities for financial independence, but it has also spawned an industry rife with exploitation. As someone deeply embedded in this world, I face a moral dilemma: I can either participate in a system that profits from obscuring knowledge, or I can work to make that knowledge freely accessible to all.\nThis Almanack represents my choice of the latter path. Just as the cypherpunks believed privacy and freedom of information could coexist, I believe we can build a more equitable crypto ecosystem without compromising its innovative potential. The fundamental act of community among cryptocurrency enthusiasts – what I call “degens” – should be the sharing of knowledge, not the hoarding of it.\nThe technical complexity of cryptocurrency has created a particularly insidious form of gatekeeping. Essential market data and analysis hide behind expensive paywalls. Crucial insights remain locked in exclusive chat groups and private networks. This artificial scarcity of knowledge directly contradicts the core ethos of Web3: permissionless access and decentralized power.\nThis Almanack aims to break down these barriers. It will serve as a comprehensive, freely accessible resource covering everything from basic concepts to advanced trading strategies. More importantly, it will evolve through community contributions, ensuring it stays relevant and accurate as the industry develops.\nSome might question why I would freely share knowledge that others sell at a premium. My answer is simple: the long-term health of our ecosystem depends on educated participants making informed decisions. When knowledge is concentrated in the hands of a few, it creates the very centralization of power that cryptocurrency was meant to disrupt.\nLooking ahead, I envision this Almanack becoming a living document that adapts to the rapid changes in our industry. I’m exploring sustainable open-source funding models, potentially through platforms like Mirror that allow for anonymous contributions. This would ensure the Almanack can continue growing while maintaining its independence from traditional financial incentives.\nThis is just the beginning. The path to truly democratized crypto knowledge will require continuous effort and collaboration. If you share this vision, I invite you to contribute your expertise, suggest improvements, or simply help spread the word. Together, we can build something that honors the original promise of cryptocurrency: financial sovereignty for all.\nThe work begins now.",

    "text": "The crypto industry suffers from a unique paradox: those with the deepest knowledge often have the strongest incentives to obscure rather than illuminate. This troubling reality became clear to me during a technical debate I witnessed on Twitter. Both participants made valid points, yet instead of building understanding, they resorted to personal attacks. What struck me wasn’t just the hostility, but the absence of a shared framework for discussion – a common language that could bridge their perspectives.\nThis observation rekindled an idea I’d been considering for years: creating a comprehensive blockchain taxonomy. But as I began mapping out the technical architecture of various networks, I realized the scope needed to be much broader. The same knowledge gaps that hindered technical discussions were even more pronounced in everyday conversations about cryptocurrency investment and usage.\nI thought about the countless conversations I’ve had with friends and family seeking crypto advice. These weren’t developers or traders – they were curious individuals trying to understand a complex new technology. Despite years of experience in the industry, I struggled to give them guidance that was both accessible and comprehensive. The existing resources seemed to fall into three troubling categories: those that oversimplified to the point of uselessness, those that drowned readers in technical jargon, and most concerningly, those designed to exploit newcomers’ curiosity to pump the authors’ own cryptocurrency holdings or use unsuspecting readers as exit liquidity.\nThis last category was particularly insidious – educational content that masqueraded as objective guidance while subtly steering readers toward specific tokens or platforms that benefited the content creator. What appeared to be helpful tutorials often turned out to be sophisticated marketing funnels, designed not to educate but to convert readers into buyers of whatever cryptocurrency the author needed to sell.\nThis Almanack aims to solve these issues. Drawing inspiration from Henry Varnum Poor’s Manual of Railroads, which brought transparency to America’s railway boom, we’re creating a resource that serves both technical and non-technical audiences. Just as Poor’s manual helped investors understand the revolutionary technology of his time, this Almanack aims to demystify the crypto industry for everyone.\nThe name “Trollip’s Degen Almanack” might seem unusual. Initially, I considered calling it a blockchain taxonomy or a Web3 guide. But these terms felt too limiting. The word “degen” – short for degenerate – carries special meaning in crypto culture. While often used ironically to describe risk-taking traders, being a degen also implies deep engagement with the technology and markets. It’s through this engaged experimentation that true understanding emerges.\nWhat sets this Almanack apart is its commitment to intellectual honesty and practical utility. We’re building it as an open-source, community-reviewed resource that will evolve alongside the technology it describes. The documentation uses version control through Git, allowing readers to track how understanding changes over time. As the industry matures, we plan to integrate real-time data sources, transforming this from a static document into a dynamic tool for decision-making.\nThe Almanack is organized into distinct paths catering to different needs:\n\nThe Path to Independence guides those seeking financial sovereignty\nThe Technologist’s Path provides deep technical understanding\nThe Financial sections offer frameworks for analysis and investment\n\nEach section builds upon the others, creating a comprehensive resource that grows with your understanding. Whether you’re a developer looking to understand economic implications, an investor studying technical fundamentals, or someone simply seeking financial independence, you’ll find your path forward here.\nThis is an ambitious undertaking, and like any first edition, it will contain errors and omissions. But by maintaining rigorous standards for evidence, encouraging community contributions, and staying true to the open-source ethos, we aim to create something valuable: a trusted guide through the often confusing world of cryptocurrency and Web3.\nThe journey begins here.

    "text": "Core Concepts\n\nDecentralization\n\n\n\nDecentralization\n\n\nDecentralization refers to the distribution of power, control, and decision-making across a network rather than concentration in a single entity. It exists on a spectrum across three key dimensions:\n\nArchitectural Decentralization: How many physical computers comprise the system? This measures the raw distribution of infrastructure - how many servers, nodes, or machines work together to maintain the network. A system running on thousands of independent computers is more architecturally decentralized than one running on a few data centers.\nPolitical Decentralization: This dimension has two crucial aspects:\nFirst, who controls the infrastructure? This looks at how many independent individuals or organizations operate the computers that run the network.\nSecond, and equally important, how are protocol changes decided and implemented? This governance aspect examines questions like: Who can propose changes? How are decisions made? What mechanisms exist for reaching consensus on updates? A truly politically decentralized system distributes both operational control and governance authority across a broad community.\nLogical Decentralization: Does the interface and data structures appear more like a single monolithic object, or an amorphous swarm? This examines whether the system works as one coherent whole or as a collection of independent parts.\n\nExamples help illustrate these distinctions:\n\nBitcoin is architecturally decentralized (thousands of nodes) and politically decentralized in both operation (many independent miners and node operators) and governance (changes require broad community consensus through BIP process). However, it remains logically centralized (one shared ledger that everyone must agree on).\nEmail is architecturally decentralized (many servers) but politically centralized both operationally (dominated by a few major providers) and in protocol governance (IETF and major providers control SMTP standards). It’s also logically centralized (standardized protocol).\nLanguage is decentralized across all three dimensions: it runs on millions of human brains (architectural), no one controls how people speak or how language evolves (political), and it can fragment into dialects and variations while remaining functional (logical).\nEthereum demonstrates how political decentralization can vary between operation and governance: while it has many independent node operators (operational decentralization), protocol changes often emerge from a relatively small group of core developers and researchers, though they still require community acceptance to implement (partial governance centralization).\n\nUnderstanding these nuances in political decentralization is crucial because governance mechanisms often become centralization points even in otherwise decentralized systems. A network might have thousands of independent operators but still be effectively controlled by a small group who can push through protocol changes.\n\n\nBlockchain\nA blockchain is a distributed database that maintains a continuously growing list of records (blocks) that are cryptographically linked to previous records. Key characteristics include:\n\nImmutability: Once data is recorded, it cannot be altered without changing all subsequent blocks\nTransparency: All transactions are public and verifiable\nConsensus: Network participants agree on the state of the system without trusting each other\n\nThe term “blockchain” has become somewhat limiting - many modern systems use different data structures while maintaining similar properties. This is why some prefer broader terms like “distributed ledger technology” or “decentralized incentive networks.”",

    "text": "Digital Assets\n\nNative Coins\nNative coins (sometimes called protocol tokens) are the primary digital assets of blockchain networks. They serve several purposes:\n\nPay for transaction fees (gas)\nSecure the network through staking or mining\nParticipate in governance\nTransfer value\n\nExamples include:\n\nBitcoin (BTC) on the Bitcoin network\nEther (ETH) on Ethereum\nSOL on Solana\n\n\n\nTokens\nTokens are digital assets created on top of blockchain platforms. They differ from native coins because they don’t secure the underlying network. Major categories include:\n\nFungible Tokens\nInterchangeable tokens where each unit is identical to every other unit. Think of them like traditional currency - any dollar bill can be exchanged for any other dollar bill. Categories include:\n\nStablecoins (USDC, DAI)\nGovernance tokens (UNI, AAVE)\nSecurity tokens\nUtility tokens\n\n\n\nNon-Fungible Tokens (NFTs)\nUnique digital assets where each token has distinct properties. Common uses include:\n\nDigital art and collectibles\nGaming items\nDomain names\nMembership passes\nReal estate titles\n\nLet me explain the nuanced distinction between meme coins and shit coins, exploring how initial intent and community dynamics can lead to very different outcomes despite similar technical foundations.\n\n\n\nMeme Coins\nMeme coins emerge from internet culture and community jokes rather than serious technological ambitions. Unlike traditional cryptocurrencies that begin with technical whitepapers and development roadmaps, meme coins often start as explicit jokes or social experiments.\nDogecoin serves as the archetypal example. Created in 2013 as a literal joke about cryptocurrency speculation, it took the Shiba Inu “doge” meme and turned it into a functioning cryptocurrency. What makes Dogecoin fascinating is how it demonstrates both the power and limitations of community-driven cryptocurrencies.\nThe Dogecoin paradox lies in its success metrics. While it has generated enormous returns for long-term holders and maintains significant market value, the network itself sees relatively little genuine economic activity. For instance, in 2023, Dogecoin processed fewer daily active addresses than many chains with fraction of its market capitalization. This creates an interesting tension - financial success without corresponding utility.\nWhat separates successful meme coins from failures is their ability to build genuine communities that transcend the initial joke. Dogecoin’s community, for example, became known for charitable initiatives and maintaining a lighthearted approach to cryptocurrency that made the space more accessible to newcomers.\n\n\nShit Coins\nShit coins, in contrast, are cryptocurrencies designed specifically to enrich their creators through sophisticated forms of financial exploitation. While they may adopt the language and aesthetics of meme coins to appear harmless or fun, their fundamental architecture is built for extraction rather than community.\nKey characteristics that distinguish shit coins include:\n\nA predatory distribution model where tokens are heavily concentrated among creators and early investors, often hidden through multiple wallets to create the illusion of decentralization.\nMarketing that focuses exclusively on price appreciation rather than utility or community building. You’ll see constant references to “going to the moon” but little discussion of actual use cases.\nCode that’s usually copied from legitimate projects but modified to include hidden mechanisms for extracting value, like privileged functions that allow creators to mint new tokens or access locked liquidity.",

    "text": "Security Concepts\n\nSeed Phrase\nA sequence of 12-24 words that serves as a backup for private keys. Also called a mnemonic phrase or recovery phrase. The words are selected from a standardized list of 2048 words and must be stored securely, as anyone with access to the seed phrase can control the associated accounts.\n\n\nSmart Contract\nA smart contract refers to code deployed and executed directly on a blockchain network, following the specific rules and constraints of that network’s virtual machine. While conceptually described as “self-executing agreements,” modern smart contracts are better understood through the capabilities and limitations of the major blockchain virtual machines that run them.\nThe Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) pioneered practical smart contracts, enabling developers to write programs that manage digital assets and execute complex logic. An EVM smart contract is essentially a program with persistent storage that responds to user interactions through transactions. While contracts are typically immutable after deployment, developers have created patterns like proxy contracts to enable upgradability - though this introduces additional complexity and security considerations.\nSolana’s runtime provides a different approach through its Sealevel parallel execution engine. Solana programs (their term for smart contracts) are compiled to Berkeley Packet Filter (BPF) bytecode and can process multiple transactions simultaneously when they don’t conflict. This enables higher throughput but requires developers to carefully consider account management and data access patterns.\nThe Move Virtual Machine, used by networks like Aptos and Sui, introduces a resource-oriented programming model. Move treats digital assets as first-class resources that can’t be copied or discarded, only moved between storage locations. This provides stronger safety guarantees for asset management but requires learning new programming patterns.\nIt’s important to distinguish these modern smart contract platforms from Bitcoin’s scripting system. While Bitcoin Script enables basic programmability for transaction validation, it intentionally limits complexity to prioritize security. It lacks features fundamental to smart contracts like persistent storage, complex control flow, and the ability to maintain state between executions. This makes it excellent for securing Bitcoin transactions but unsuitable for general-purpose computation.\nCommon misconceptions about smart contracts include:\nTheir “automatic” nature - they only execute when triggered by transactions and depend on external participants to initiate interactions.\nPerfect determinism - while execution is deterministic within a single network, subtle differences between virtual machine implementations can cause unexpected behaviors across different chains or network upgrades.\nComplete transparency - while bytecode is publicly visible on the blockchain, understanding a contract’s behavior often requires access to the original source code and careful analysis. Not all developers verify their source code through block explorers, making security audits challenging.\nThe term “smart contract” continues to evolve as new virtual machines and programming models emerge. Rather than thinking of them as magical self-executing agreements, it’s more accurate to view them as programs constrained by their underlying virtual machines, each making different tradeoffs between functionality, security, and performance.",

    "section": "",
    "text": "The story of digital independence begins not with blockchains or cryptocurrencies, but with a profound recognition: the tools that brought unprecedented convenience to our lives have also created unprecedented control over them.\nConsider your daily financial life. Your morning coffee purchase creates a data point. Your salary arrives through systems you don’t control. Your savings exist primarily as numbers in someone else’s database. This convenience comes with hidden costs - your transactions can be blocked, your accounts frozen, your privacy compromised. Each small sacrifice of control seemed reasonable in isolation, but together they’ve created golden handcuffs of financial dependence.\nThis isn’t accidental. The post-industrial financial system runs on centralization because it’s efficient. Banks can process thousands of transactions per second. Credit cards work seamlessly across borders. Mobile payments happen with a fingerprint. But this efficiency masks a fundamental truth - you’re asking permission to use your own money.\nThe early cypherpunks understood this tradeoff. In 1993, Eric Hughes wrote in the Cypherpunk Manifesto:\n“Privacy is necessary for an open society in the electronic age. Privacy is not secrecy. A private matter is something one doesn’t want the whole world to know, but a secret matter is something one doesn’t want anybody to know. Privacy is the power to selectively reveal oneself to the world.”\nThey saw that digital privacy would become inseparable from freedom. Without privacy in our transactions and communications, true independence would be impossible. But they also understood that simply criticizing the system wasn’t enough - they needed to build alternatives.\nThis brings us to public key cryptography, the foundation of digital independence. Imagine having a special lock that anyone can use to send you messages or money, but only you can open. No permission needed, no middlemen required, no central authority to approve or deny. This isn’t just technical theory - it’s a practical tool for independence.\nBitcoin emerged from this foundation, but it would be a mistake to see it as just digital money. It proved that we could create systems where trust comes from mathematics and consensus rather than institutions. Where rules are enforced by code rather than policy. Where participation is permissionless rather than granted.\nThe path to digital independence isn’t about rejecting modern convenience - it’s about reclaiming control while preserving it. We’ll learn to:\n\nHold assets that can’t be frozen or seized\nCommunicate without surveillance\nTrade without gatekeepers\nBuild systems that resist control\n\nBut this power comes with responsibility. In traditional systems, mistakes can often be reversed. Passwords can be reset. Transactions can be disputed. In truly independent systems, you alone are responsible for your security. Your privacy. Your choices.\nThis Almanack exists because that responsibility requires knowledge. Not just technical knowledge, though that’s important, but practical wisdom. Understanding not just how these systems work, but why they matter. Learning not just to use tools, but to think independently about digital freedom.\nThe journey of digital independence is both personal and collective. Each person who takes control of their digital life strengthens the network for everyone. Each developer who builds privacy-preserving tools expands what’s possible. We’re not just users of a new system - we’re participants in its evolution.\nIn the coming chapters, we’ll explore both the philosophical foundations and practical tools of digital independence. Whether you’re a developer looking to build these systems or someone seeking to use them, understanding these foundations is essential. Because digital independence isn’t given - it’s learned, practiced, and ultimately, earned.",

    "section": "",
    "text": "From Ciphers to Smart Contracts\nThe story of cryptocurrency begins long before Bitcoin. It starts with a simple question that has challenged mathematicians and philosophers for millennia: How can we share secrets safely?\nAncient Rome used the Caesar cipher to protect military communications. Medieval merchants developed complex codes to secure trade routes. During World War II, the breaking of the Enigma machine’s encryption changed the course of history. Each advance in cryptography came from the need to communicate privately in an unsafe world.\nBut the true revolution began in the 1970s with two breakthroughs that would eventually make digital money possible: public key cryptography and the development of secure network protocols.\nIn 1976, Whitfield Diffie and Martin Hellman solved a problem that had seemed impossible: how could two people who had never met establish a shared secret over an insecure channel? Their solution, known as public key cryptography, created the foundation for secure digital communications. A few years later, Ron Rivest, Adi Shamir, and Leonard Adleman developed the RSA algorithm, making these theoretical ideas practical.\nThe 1980s saw the birth of the Cypherpunk movement. These technologists and privacy advocates believed that cryptography could protect individual liberty in the digital age. They weren’t just mathematicians – they were philosophers who saw privacy as essential to human dignity and freedom.\nDavid Chaum, a pioneer in cryptographic privacy, proposed the first digital cash system in 1983. His DigiCash company later implemented these ideas, but ultimately failed – partly because it remained centralized, requiring trust in a single company.\nThe 1990s brought both advances and setbacks. Phil Zimmermann released PGP (Pretty Good Privacy), bringing strong encryption to everyday users. The U.S. government, viewing strong cryptography as a national security threat, tried to mandate backdoors through the Clipper Chip. The resulting “Crypto Wars” ended with cryptography being classified as protected speech.\nThrough these battles, the Cypherpunks refined their vision. In 1993, Eric Hughes published “A Cypherpunk’s Manifesto,” declaring that “privacy is necessary for an open society in the electronic age.” The movement explored various approaches to digital money: Nick Szabo’s bit gold, Wei Dai’s b-money, and Adam Back’s Hashcash all contributed crucial ideas.\nThen came 2008. As the global financial system teetered on the brink of collapse, an anonymous figure calling themselves Satoshi Nakamoto published a paper titled “Bitcoin: A Peer-to-Peer Electronic Cash System.” Bitcoin solved a problem that had stymied previous attempts at digital money: how to achieve consensus about ownership without trusting any central authority.\nBitcoin’s genius lay in combining existing technologies in a novel way. It used public key cryptography for identity, cryptographic hash functions for mining, and a distributed ledger to record transactions. Most importantly, it created an economic incentive structure that made the system self-sustaining.\nThe early Bitcoin years were marked by experimentation and growing pains. The first known commercial transaction occurred in 2010 when Laszlo Hanyecz paid 10,000 BTC for two pizzas – bitcoins that would later be worth hundreds of millions of dollars. Mt. Gox, the largest Bitcoin exchange, collapsed in 2014, teaching harsh lessons about the risks of centralized custody.\nBy 2013, a young programmer named Vitalik Buterin saw both Bitcoin’s potential and its limitations. Bitcoin’s simple scripting language was intentionally restricted to prevent complex computations that could slow the network. Buterin proposed Ethereum, a platform that would add a complete programming language to blockchain technology.\nEthereum launched in 2015, introducing the concept of smart contracts – self-executing programs stored on the blockchain. This opened up entirely new possibilities. Instead of just transferring value, users could create complex financial instruments, digital organizations, and decentralized applications.\nThe next major innovation came in 2018 with the launch of Uniswap, which introduced automated market makers (AMMs) to crypto. Traditional order book exchanges require active market makers to provide liquidity. AMMs used smart contracts to create passive, algorithm-driven markets that could operate 24/7 without human intervention.\nThis sparked the DeFi (Decentralized Finance) revolution. Compound introduced algorithmic lending markets. Aave pioneered flash loans. Curve optimized stable asset trading. Each innovation built on previous ones, creating increasingly sophisticated financial infrastructure.\nBut Ethereum’s success brought scaling challenges. High transaction fees during peak usage made smaller transactions impractical. This spurred development of alternative approaches. Solana launched in 2020, using a proof-of-history mechanism to achieve higher throughput. The Move programming language, first developed for Facebook’s Libra project, influenced platforms like Aptos and Sui that prioritized safer smart contract development.\nLayer 2 scaling solutions emerged as another approach. Optimistic rollups like Arbitrum and Optimism, and zero-knowledge rollups like zkSync and StarkNet, aimed to increase Ethereum’s capacity while inheriting its security. Each made different tradeoffs between speed, cost, and decentralization.\nThis brings us to today. We’ve moved from simple ciphers to programmable money, from centralized experiments to decentralized networks. Each step built on previous innovations while solving new challenges. Understanding this history helps us appreciate both how far we’ve come and the challenges that still lie ahead.\nThe cypherpunks believed privacy tools could reshape society. They were right, but perhaps not in the way they expected. Cryptocurrency has indeed changed how we think about money, but its greatest impact may be in showing that alternative financial systems are possible. As we look to the future, we carry forward their core insight: mathematical tools, properly designed, can create new forms of human coordination and freedom.",

The same industry that began as a rebellion against financial intermediaries now builds new forms of intermediation. Venture capital firms that once missed the internet boom now rush to stake their claims.

Mass adoption requires user-friendly interfaces, institutional investment needs regulatory clarity, and complex systems benefit from specialized service providers. But other changes represent a more fundamental drift from crypto’s founding principles.\nConsider how: - “Not your keys, not your coins” became “Trust our custody solution” - “Censorship resistant” became “Compliant with all regulations” - “Trustless” became “Trust our proprietary trading engine” - “Decentralized” became “Controlled by a small group of token holders”",

This might mean:\n\nBuilding better self-custody solutions that match centralized convenience\nCreating privacy-preserving compliance mechanisms\nDeveloping truly decentralized governance systems\nFocusing on real-world utility over speculation\nMaintaining open protocols alongside commercial services\n\nThe original vision of cryptocurrency remains powerful: a world where financial freedom doesn’t require anyone’s permission, where privacy is protected by mathematics rather than policies, and where trust comes from transparent code rather than opaque institutions. Realizing this vision means neither rejecting all compromise nor accepting every dilution of principle, but rather finding ways to make radical ideas practical.\nFor both regular people and technologists seeking alternatives to centralized systems, the core question remains: How do we build systems that preserve freedom while serving human needs?

While traditional finance relies on banks, brokers, and other intermediaries, DeFi uses smart contracts – self-executing computer programs – to enable direct peer-to-peer financial activities. This shift removes gatekeepers and creates opportunities for anyone with an internet connection to access sophisticated financial services.\nWhile Ethereum pioneered DeFi, its high transaction costs can make learning expensive, with fees sometimes exceeding $50 per transaction. This is why we’ll start our journey on Base, a Layer 2 network built on top of Ethereum. Base offers the same capabilities but with dramatically lower fees, typically under $1 per transaction.

Gox collapse in 2014.\nCultural Impact: - Serves as a constant reminder of cryptocurrency’s original purpose: financial self-sovereignty - Often shared after exchange hacks or failures - Has evolved into a teaching tool for newcomers - Frequently referenced in discussions about centralized exchanges and custody solutions\nReal-world examples that reinforced this meme: - Mt. Gox (2014): 850,000 BTC lost - QuadrigaCX (2019): $190 million lost - FTX (2022): Billions in customer funds lost\n\n\nHODL\nPerhaps the most famous cryptocurrency meme, “HODL” originated from a typo that became a battle cry for long-term investors.\nOrigin: December 18, 2013, when GameKyuubi posted “I AM HODLING” on the BitcoinTalk forum during a market crash. The poster, admittedly drunk, wrote a passionate defense of holding Bitcoin despite price volatility.\nEvolution: 1. Initial phase: Simple misspelling joke 2. Secondary meaning: “Hold On for Dear Life” 3. Modern usage: Philosophical approach to cryptocurrency investment\nCultural significance: - Represents conviction in long-term value over short-term trading - Creates solidarity among investors during market downturns - Differentiates investment approaches (HODLers vs. traders) - Has spawned related terms like “diamond hands”",

    "text": "The Foundation: Cryptographic Primitives\nAt its core, Web3 relies on cryptographic tools that provide mathematical guarantees rather than promises. Public key cryptography lets us create digital signatures that can’t be forged. Hash functions generate unique digital fingerprints that can’t be reversed. Zero-knowledge proofs allow us to verify facts without revealing underlying information. These building blocks make it possible to create systems with unprecedented security properties.\nConsider how these tools work together: When you make a blockchain transaction, you use a private key to create a signature (public key cryptography), which is then combined with transaction data to create a unique identifier (hash functions), which might be verified privately (zero-knowledge proofs). Understanding these primitives helps you see not just how current systems work, but how future ones might be designed.",

Originally called “Miner Extractable Value,” the term has evolved to “Maximal” as extraction techniques have expanded beyond just miners. At its core, MEV emerges from the ability to reorder, insert, or censor transactions within a block for profit.\nThink of a blockchain as a series of auctions where the auctioneer (block producer) can not only decide which bids to accept but also their order. This power creates opportunities for profit that don’t exist in traditional markets.",

It’s essentially a sorted list of all the prices at which market participants are willing to buy (bids) and sell (asks) an asset.\n\nHow CLOBs Work\nA CLOB operates on simple but powerful principles:\n\nOrder Types\n\nLimit Orders: Instructions to buy or sell at a specific price or better\nMarket Orders: Instructions to buy or sell immediately at the best available price\n\nPrice-Time Priority\n\nOrders are matched based on price priority (best prices first)\nWhen prices are equal, earlier orders get priority\nThis creates a fair “first come, first served” system\n\n\nHere’s a simplified visualization of an order book:\n     ASKS\nPrice | Size\n105   | 10\n104   | 15\n103   | 20\n-----------------\n102   | 25\n101   | 30\n100   | 35\n     BIDS\n\n\nOrder Matching Logic\nWhen new orders arrive, they’re matched against existing orders following strict rules:\n\nMarket orders match immediately with the best available price\nLimit orders join the book if they can’t match immediately\nPartial fills are possible when order sizes don’t match exactly\n\nFor example, if someone submits a market buy order for 30 units in the above book, they would: - Buy 20 units at 103 - Buy 10 units at 104 - Pay an average price of 103.33",

I’ll adjust the ratings and add more descriptive characteristics for lower-rated assets.\nThe key change will be to make anything below B rating an explicit designation of a shit coin, with clear warning signs and red flags. Here’s the revised ratings structure:\n\n\n\nRating Categories\n\nAAA (95-100)\nAssets in this category demonstrate exceptional characteristics across all evaluation metrics: - Proven value capture mechanisms generating sustainable protocol revenue - Industry-leading security practices with multiple audits and bug bounties - Deep, distributed liquidity across multiple venues - Active governance with high community participation - Minimal toxic MEV exposure with sophisticated protection mechanisms\n\n\nAA (85-94)\nStrong performers with proven track records: - Consistent value capture through fees and treasury growth - Robust security with regular audits and minimal vulnerabilities - Healthy liquidity distribution and market maker participation - Well-established governance frameworks - Effectively managed MEV exposure\n\n\nA (75-84)\nSolid protocols with good fundamentals: - Demonstrable value capture, though perhaps not maximized - Sound security practices with no major incidents - Adequate liquidity across major venues - Functional governance with active participation - Controlled MEV exposure with basic protections\n\n\nBBB (65-74)\nModerate performers showing some concerns: - Value capture mechanisms exist but may need optimization - Security meets basic standards but could be improved - Liquidity concentrated in fewer venues - Governance participation may be limited - Notable MEV exposure requiring attention\n\n\nBB (55-64)\nProjects showing significant warning signs: - Limited or declining value capture - Security concerns requiring immediate attention - Thin liquidity with high concentration risk - Governance challenges or low participation - High MEV exposure with inadequate protection\n\n\nB (50-54)\nThe minimum threshold for legitimate projects: - Struggling but legitimate value capture attempts - Basic security measures in place - Limited but genuine liquidity - Simple but functional governance - Significant MEV vulnerability but with some mitigation attempts\n\n\nC and Below (&lt;50) - Shit Coin Territory\nAny asset rated below B exhibits characteristics of a shit coin:\n\nC (40-49) - Highly Speculative\n\nMinimal genuine value capture\nCopied or unaudited code\nArtificial or manipulated liquidity\nCentralized control masked as governance\nSevere MEV exploitation risks\n\n\n\nD (30-39) - Likely Exploitative\n\nNo legitimate value capture mechanism\nSecurity vulnerabilities or backdoors\nWash trading and fake volume\nGovernance controlled by insiders\nDesigned for MEV extraction\n\n\n\nF (&lt;30) - Confirmed Shit Coin\n\nPurely extractive tokenomics\nCopied code with hidden minting functions\nConcentrated ownership masked through multiple wallets\nNon-existent or fake governance\nBuilt specifically for price manipulation\n\n\n\n\nWarning Signs of Shit Coins:\n\nToken distribution heavily concentrated among creators\nCode copied directly from other projects without meaningful improvements\nLiquidity that appears deep but is controlled by a few addresses\nGovernance tokens with hidden privileges for insiders\nMarketing focused entirely on price appreciation\nNo genuine protocol revenue beyond token inflation\nTeam anonymity combined with privileged access to contract functions\n\nThe critical distinction between a B-rated project and a shit coin lies not just in technical metrics but in genuine intent and community alignment. While B-rated projects may struggle with execution, they represent legitimate attempts to create value. Anything rated C or below represents projects designed primarily for extraction rather than value creation.\nThis framework helps identify shit coins not just through technical analysis but by examining the alignment between stated goals and actual implementation. A project’s placement in shit coin territory isn’t just about current performance but about fundamental design choices that prioritize extraction over value creation.",

This is the fundamental challenge of Web3 governance. While blockchains provide the technical foundation for decentralized systems, governance represents the crucial social layer that determines how these systems evolve and adapt.",

    "section": "The Three Branches of Blockchain Governance",
    "text": "The Three Branches of Blockchain Governance\nJust as traditional governments often separate power into executive, legislative, and judicial branches, blockchain systems have developed their own versions of these divisions, though they manifest in unique ways.\n\nLegislative Function: Rule Creation\nThe legislative function in blockchain systems determines how rules are created and modified. This happens through several mechanisms:\n\nImprovement Proposals\n\nBitcoin’s BIP (Bitcoin Improvement Proposal) process\nEthereum’s EIP (Ethereum Improvement Proposal) system\nVarious DAO governance frameworks\n\n\nThese processes share common elements but differ in crucial ways. Bitcoin’s process emphasizes conservative change and broad consensus, reflecting its role as a monetary system. Ethereum’s process moves faster and accommodates more types of changes, matching its position as a computational platform.\n\nDiscussion Forums\n\nTechnical debates\nEconomic proposals\nSocial coordination\n\n\nThese spaces serve as the “town halls” of blockchain governance, where ideas are debated before formal proposals.\n\n\nExecutive Function: Rule Implementation\nThe executive function in blockchain systems determines how agreed-upon changes are actually implemented. This involves:\n\nNode Operators\n\nRunning specific software versions\nEnforcing consensus rules\nMaintaining network security\n\nDevelopers\n\nWriting and reviewing code\nImplementing approved changes\nMaintaining client software\n\nMiners/Validators\n\nProcessing transactions\nProducing blocks\nSecuring the network\n\n\nThe relationship between these groups creates interesting dynamics. For example, while developers can write code for a change, node operators must choose to run it, creating a check on developer power.\n\n\nJudicial Function: Rule Interpretation\nThe judicial function in blockchain systems is perhaps the most different from traditional governance. Instead of courts interpreting laws, we see:\n\nEconomic Consensus\n\nMarkets pricing in decisions\nUsers choosing which chains to use\nCapital flowing between projects\n\nSocial Consensus\n\nCommunity interpretation of rules\nPrecedent in dispute resolution\nNorm establishment\n\nTechnical Arbitration\n\nProtocol-level dispute resolution\nOracle systems\nSmart contract execution",

    "section": "The Politics of Decentralization",
    "text": "The Politics of Decentralization\nBlockchain governance must constantly navigate several fundamental tensions:\n\n1. Decentralization vs. Efficiency\nMore decentralized decision-making typically means slower, more costly coordination. This creates pressure to centralize for efficiency, which must be balanced against the core value of decentralization.\n\n\n2. Innovation vs. Stability\nFaster technical innovation often requires more centralized decision-making, while maintaining stability typically requires broader consensus. Different projects position themselves along this spectrum based on their priorities.\n\n\n3. On-Chain vs. Off-Chain Governance\nOn-chain governance provides clarity and automation but can be rigid and plutocratic. Off-chain governance offers more flexibility but can lack clarity and finality. Most successful projects use a hybrid approach.",

Incentive Alignment\n\nToken distributions\nFee sharing models\nStaking requirements\nReputation systems\n\nWell-designed incentives help ensure participants act in ways that benefit the system as a whole.\n\n\n3. Exit Rights\n\nThe ability to fork\nAsset withdrawal rights\nAlternative platforms\nMarket competition\n\nThe credible threat of exit helps keep systems accountable to their communities.",

    "text": "Best Practices in Web3 Governance\nThrough years of experimentation, several governance best practices have emerged:\n\n1. Progressive Decentralization\nStarting with more centralized control and gradually decentralizing as systems mature has proven more successful than attempting complete decentralization from day one.\n\n\n2. Layered Decision Making\nDifferent types of decisions require different processes: - Technical parameters: Automated adjustment - Protocol upgrades: Formal governance - Emergency responses: Rapid response mechanisms\n\n\n3. Transparent Communication\n\nClear documentation\nRegular updates\nOpen discussion forums\nRecorded decision-making\n\n\n\n4. Governance Minimization\nThe most successful systems tend to minimize what requires active governance, automating what they can and leaving other decisions to market forces.",
