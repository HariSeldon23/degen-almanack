It may enable them to make more money, but it requires them to feel in conflict with humanity rather than feel as comrades.\nThe fundamental act of friendship among degens is the sharing of knowledge. Knowledge in crypto, due to it’s technical complexity has attracted a special type of exploitation. High pay walls for access to data goes against the very ethos of Web3.",

    "text": "The genesis of this book was reading a technical argument on Twitter that was steeped in ideology. I agreed with both parties on certain points, yet the two combatants resorted to ad hominen attacks, both lacking a standardized framework in which to couch their arguments. This led me to rekindle an idea I’d had years before, to create a blockchain taxonomy. Something that would be easily accessible and would be able to be used to quickly dispel bad faith arguments.\nAfter building out the initial taxonomy, the breadth of the task started to dawn on me. The potential of it could be expanded to provide value not just to the technical community but to all parties interested in blockchain technology. I kept recalling the numerous conversations with family and friends asking for crypto investment advice. This wonderful patchwork of humanity I’ve had the fortune of spending my life with and how I could never give them an answer that spanned the breadth of this fascinating industry I love. Even sadder, I had no way of giving them advice concise enough for them to follow, that matched their investment goals.\nWhat then if there was a book, an Almanack for lack of a better word, that I could give to these people. A book that would educate, illuminate and help them make well informed investing decisions. While still straddling a fine line of being technically honest on how to safely navigate these waters.\nTaking a cue from history, following in the footsteps of Henry Vanrum Poor when he recognized the need for reliable information about the booming railroad companies. This takes inspiration from that venture with a modern twist. In line with the cypherpunk manifesto(Hughes 1993) and the open source communities (Raymond 1999) which I admire so much, this Almanack will be open source and community contributed. As a core tenet of the Cypherpunk manifesto, contributors identity will be less important than their reputation. The knowledge will be curated and go through an approval process via Github Pull Requests. The other innovation is that as the Alamack evolves over time it will integrate with real time data sources in order to provide a dynamic document that plugs into the market as it evolves.\nA brief note on the naming of the book. Initially I wanted to call it blockchain taxonomy, reflecting it’s early design goals. However as I worked more and more and it evolved into something much broader than a Taxonomy, Almanack made a lot more sense. Initially I liked Trollip’s Web3 Almanack. But all the broader terms for this industry have severe limitations. I consider myself a degen. And while it’s a loaded term, it’s being a degen that has armed me with the knowledge to attempt this ambitious venture. Hence Trollip’s Degen Almanack.\n\n\n\n\nHughes, Eric. 1993. “A Cypherpunk’s Manifesto,” March. https://www.activism.net/cypherpunk/manifesto.html.\n\n\nRaymond, Eric S. 1999.

    "text": "Web3\nWithin this Almanack we use the term Web3 rather than Crypto. While our industry is built on the back bone of cryptography, it encompasses not only a branch of mathematics, but economic, social, technological and political aspects. Web3 more closely aligns with the breadth of our industry.\nBelow you can see how the web has evolved into Web3.\n\n\n\nEvolution of the Web\n\n\n\nWeb1 (1990s): static websites, read-only content\nWeb2 (2000s - 2010s): Interactive social platforms, user-generated content\nWeb3 (2020s+): Decentralized networks, blockchain, user-owned data and assets\n\n\nDecentralization\n\n\n\nNetwork Topologies\n\n\n\n\n\nBlockchains\n\nLayer 1\nCurrently there is no formally and universally accepted definition of what comprises a L1 Network.\nWe have taken these sources in order to come up with our definition:\n\n(Nakamoto 2008) for Bitcoin\n(Buterin 2013) for Ethereum\n(Buterin 2021) for the rollups guide\n(Charbonneau 2023) for John’s excellent guide to rollups\n\nNakamoto’s Bitcoin whitepaper, while not explicitly using the term “Layer 1,” established the core principles of what we now recognize as Layer 1 characteristics: a base protocol that handles consensus, security, and data availability without relying on any other blockchain system. This introduced the concept of a self-contained, sovereign blockchain network.\nThe Ethereum whitepaper expanded this foundation by introducing programmability and demonstrating that a Layer 1 could be more than just a payment system. It showed that a Layer 1 blockchain serves as a foundation for broader computational capabilities while maintaining the core properties of decentralization and security.\nButerin’s rollup guide helps define Layer 1 by contrast - it clarifies what makes a base layer distinct from scaling solutions built on top of it. This work emphasizes that a Layer 1 blockchain must handle three critical functions: data availability, consensus, and execution, all while maintaining decentralization.\nCharbonneau’s report further refines our understanding by examining how Layer 1 blockchains interact with scaling solutions, highlighting their role as the security and settlement layer of the blockchain ecosystem.\nSynthesizing these sources, we can define a Layer 1 blockchain as:\nA sovereign blockchain network that provides three fundamental guarantees without relying on any other blockchain system:\n\nconsensus - the ability to agree on the state of the network\ndata availability - ensuring all transaction data is publicly accessible and verifiable\nexecution - the processing of transactions and state changes. It must do this while maintaining decentralization in its security model and serving as the ultimate settlement layer where the final state of all transactions is recorded.\n\n\nSettlement Layer\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLayer 2\nThere is no canonical definition of L2’s.\nWe use:\n\n(Gluchowski 2019)\n(Poon and Buterin 2017)\n(Poon and Dryja 2016)\n(Buterin 2021)\n(Charbonneau 2023)\n\nTo come up with the following Framework\n\nData Availability\n\n\nOn-chain (Rollups)\nOff-chain (Validiums, Plasma, Sidechains)\n\n\nSecurity Model\n\n\nInherited from L1 (Rollups, Validiums)\nIndependent (Sidechains)\nHybrid (Plasma)\n\n\nState Validation\n\n\nFraud Proofs (Optimistic Rollups)\nValidity Proofs (ZK Rollups, Validiums)\nIndependent (Sidechains)\nMerkle Roots (Plasma)\n\n\nSettlement Mechanism\n\n\nDirect (Rollups)\nChallenge Period (Optimistic Rollups)\nExit Games (Plasma)\nBridge/Peg (Sidechains)",

The term originated from gambling culture but has been embraced by the crypto community as a semi-ironic badge of honor.\n\nTrading Behavior: Degens are known for taking high-risk positions, often using significant leverage, and engaging in yield farming, liquidity mining, and other complex DeFi strategies.\nCultural Identity: Unlike traditional finance’s negative connotation of “degenerate gambling,” the crypto community has reclaimed “degen” as a positive or playful identifier. It represents a willingness to experiment with new protocols and take calculated risks.\nTechnical Sophistication: Despite the seeming recklessness implied by the term, many “degens” are highly knowledgeable about blockchain technology, smart contracts, and DeFi mechanics. They’re often early adopters of new protocols and technologies.\nCommunity Role: Degens play an important role in crypto ecosystems by providing early liquidity to new protocols, testing experimental features, and contributing to the rapid evolution of DeFi products.",

    "text": "HODL\nThere will be a lot of references to meme’s in your journey to become a Gigabrain Degen. It’s important to understand them. Culture is a massive part of Web3 and will help you immensely in your journey.\nHODL originated as a misspelling of “hold” in a 2013 Bitcoin forum post titled “I AM HODLING.” The post’s author, frustrated by their poor trading performance during a Bitcoin price crash, declared they would simply hold onto their Bitcoin rather than try to time the market. The typographical error caught on as both a meme and an investment philosophy in the cryptocurrency community.\nThe term has evolved beyond its humorous origins to represent a long-term investment strategy often summarized as “Hold On for Dear Life.” This reflects the mindset of cryptocurrency investors who maintain their positions despite extreme market volatility, believing in the long-term value proposition of their assets rather than attempting to profit from short-term price movements.\nHODL also represents a rejection of traditional trading wisdom. While conventional financial markets emphasize technical analysis and market timing, HODLing suggests that, particularly in the volatile cryptocurrency space, a simple buy-and-hold strategy might outperform active trading for many investors. This approach acknowledges the difficulty of timing a highly volatile, 24/7 global market.\nThe term has become so influential that it helps identify different types of market participants. “HODLers” are often contrasted with “traders” or “speculators,” with HODLers viewed as providing market stability through their long-term commitment to holding assets. During market downturns, the community often encourages “HODL” as a way to maintain conviction and avoid panic selling.\nThe concept of HODLing has also influenced how blockchain projects design their token economics. Many projects now include staking mechanisms, vesting schedules, and other features that encourage long-term holding, showing how a simple misspelling has evolved into a fundamental aspect of cryptocurrency culture and economics.",

So we’ll take a pragmatic approach and introduce those concepts in incremental levels of difficulty.\nSo the first thing anyone entering Web3 needs to do is to purcahse some Crypto. In this Chapter we’ll walk you through the process, with the important caveats below:\nWe will use Coinbase as the CEX for this section. You’re more than welcome to use your local CEX. For users in countries that don’t have access to CEX’s, we’ll detail how they can purchase their first crypto with Bisq.\nDue to me wanting anyone to be able to get into crypto, I’m pretty adamanant that it shouldn’t cost more than $5 for people to learn. This is why I’d like to tailor this to start off with people purchasing ETH\nhttps://bisq.network/downloads/\nI’m using the Bisq 2 version, although at the time of writing, it’s still in beta. There is a minimum requirement of 6 USD. The median income is approximately $7 per day.\nOn Bisq the minimum amount I could find someone willing to trade with me is 10 USD. Also it’s sold at a huge premium. Further disenfranchizing the world’s poor. As such if anyone wants to purchase Bitcoin for $10 please reach out to me Bisq kinda sucks. Hodl Hodl looks like a much better solution\nGet them to create an account at a CEX. Explain KYC/AML\nTalk about why you never hold funds on a CEX. Go through FTX, Mount Gox and other failures. Then talk about wallets.\nWe’re going with Phantom as it supports: * Bitcoin * Ethereum * Solana * Base * Polygon\nAs of writing, TVL across Ethereum has 54%, Solana 7%, Base and Bitcoin both ~3%. So while I’d love a wallet that supports Stacks, Move and Cosmos. That just doesn’t exist today. So as a first time Web3 user, Phantom just makes the most sense. I also really wanted users first wallet to have social recovery. But no wallet currently supprots this. Argent used to, but they’re now only on Starknet and Soul wallet has no downloadable version I could find.\nNeed to talk about storing of private key\nSo we’ll purchase ETH, transfer it to our Phantom wallet, and then stake it on Lido",

For us to represent all Digital Assets within this space, it means we need to include all Web3 financial instruments, both on chain and off chain.\nWe take inspiration from the Fat Protocol Thesis(Monegro 2016) to define the major categories of Digital Assets within the Web3 realm. We also adhere to the naming convention that stipulates Coins are digital assets relating to the running and operation of a Blockchain, whereas Tokens are digital assets that are issued on a Blockchain.\nWe thus break down Digital Assets into the following Categories:\nAfter describing the various categories and classes of Digital Assets we’ll then delve into the Markets existing for these Digital Assets, as well as how an entity hodls the Digital Asset and the yield properties of the various types of Digital Assets.\nThis section deals primarily with Digital Assets as a Financial Instrument and as such any information relating to the technical makeup can be found in the Blockchain documentation.",

As such we don’t refer to networks here by Layer 1 or Layer 2. That’s a classification and distinction you can explore here.\nWe define a Base Network that maintains it’s own Sovereignity. This means that the Coin on the network is used to economically secure the chain as well as final settlement to occur on this network.\n\n\nSecondary Networks\nThese are networks that market themselves as settling the transactions on another network. The nuances of how they settle is covered under the Blockchain chapter.

    "text": "Dependent Network Ratings\nPolygon zkEVM Settlement Guarantees (10/10 weight): Score: 9/10 The zkEVM uses zero-knowledge proofs to validate all state transitions. Every transaction batch includes a proof that mathematically demonstrates the correctness of all computations and state changes. These proofs are verified by Ethereum’s consensus mechanism, providing cryptographic certainty that state transitions are valid. This is nearly the highest level of settlement guarantee possible, just slightly below fully integrated L2s because of some optimizations in the proving system.\nDispute Resolution (9/10 weight): Score: 10/10 Ethereum serves as the absolute source of truth for the zkEVM. If there’s ever a dispute about the state, the zero-knowledge proofs verified by Ethereum’s consensus provide mathematical certainty about what is correct. There’s no dependency on fraud proofs or challenge periods - the cryptographic proofs mean disputes are resolved immediately and with absolute certainty by Ethereum.\nEconomic Security Inheritance (8/10 weight): Score: 9/10 The zkEVM inherits its fundamental security from Ethereum. The validity proofs mean it can’t confirm invalid state transitions, and its assets are secured by Ethereum’s consensus mechanism. While it has its own token (MATIC) for gas fees and other purposes, the core economic security - particularly for assets like ETH and tokens - comes directly from Ethereum.\nState Finality (7/10 weight): Score: 9/10 Once Ethereum confirms a zkEVM batch and its validity proof, that state is final with the same guarantees as Ethereum itself. The mathematical nature of the zero-knowledge proofs means there’s no waiting period for finality beyond Ethereum’s own finality period. This is as strong as state finality can get for a settlement-dependent network.\nExit Rights Guarantees (6/10 weight): Score: 8/10 Users can always withdraw their assets back to Ethereum by submitting a withdrawal request. These withdrawals are guaranteed by Ethereum’s consensus - once a withdrawal is proven valid through a ZK proof, no one can prevent the user from claiming their assets on Ethereum. The only limitation is the normal proving and processing time.\nState Progression Dependency (5/10 weight): Score: 7/10 While the zkEVM can process transactions independently, it can’t finalize new states without submitting proofs to Ethereum and having them verified. This creates a strong dependency on Ethereum for state progression, though there’s some independence in transaction processing.\nAsset Movement (4/10 weight): Score: 10/10 Native ETH and ERC-20 tokens can move seamlessly between Ethereum and the zkEVM. When assets move to the zkEVM, they’re locked on Ethereum and can only be unlocked through valid proofs. This provides the strongest possible guarantees for asset movement between the networks.\nTotal Score: 62/70 (approximately 89%)\nThis analysis places Polygon zkEVM firmly in the “Fully Non-Sovereign” category. Arbitrum Let me analyze Arbitrum’s relationship with Ethereum as a Settlement-Dependent Network by carefully examining each criterion. This will help us understand how optimistic rollups differ from ZK rollups in their settlement dependency.\nSettlement Guarantees (10/10 weight): Score: 7/10 Arbitrum uses an optimistic rollup design where transactions are assumed valid but can be challenged during a dispute period (currently 7 days). While this provides strong settlement guarantees, it’s not as immediate or mathematically certain as ZK rollups. The challenge period introduces a time-based element to settlement finality. However, the ability to prove fraud on Ethereum’s consensus layer still makes this a robust settlement mechanism.\nDispute Resolution (9/10 weight): Score: 8/10 Ethereum serves as the ultimate arbiter for Arbitrum through its fraud proof system. If someone identifies an invalid state transition, they can submit a fraud proof to Ethereum, which will automatically resolve the dispute and revert invalid transactions. This is strong dispute resolution, though not as immediate as ZK proofs since it requires active challengers and a challenge period. The key strength is that Ethereum’s consensus automatically enforces the correct resolution once fraud is proven.\nEconomic Security Inheritance (8/10 weight): Score: 9/10 Arbitrum inherits its fundamental security from Ethereum. The ability to prove fraud on Ethereum means that any attempt to corrupt Arbitrum’s state would require corrupting Ethereum itself. The sequencer role adds some centralization risk, but the fundamental economic security - particularly for assets - comes directly from Ethereum. Users can always force transactions through Ethereum if the sequencer fails.\nState Finality (7/10 weight): Score: 6/10 While Arbitrum’s state updates are recorded on Ethereum, true finality requires waiting through the challenge period. This creates a tradeoff between practical finality (which can be quite fast) and absolute finality (which requires waiting for the challenge period). This is lower than ZK rollups where finality is immediate once proofs are verified.\nExit Rights Guarantees (6/10 weight): Score: 8/10 Users can always withdraw their assets to Ethereum, guaranteed by Ethereum’s consensus. While withdrawals require waiting through the challenge period, they cannot be prevented by Arbitrum’s operators. The delay is longer than with ZK rollups, but the guarantee is just as strong once the period passes.\nState Progression Dependency (5/10 weight): Score: 7/10 Arbitrum can process transactions independently but must submit state roots to Ethereum for potential verification. While it has more processing independence than some systems, it ultimately depends on Ethereum for final state confirmation, especially during disputes.\nAsset Movement (4/10 weight): Score: 10/10 Native ETH and ERC-20 tokens move seamlessly between Ethereum and Arbitrum through a strong bridge mechanism backed by Ethereum’s consensus. When assets move to Arbitrum, they’re locked on Ethereum and can only be unlocked through valid withdrawals after the challenge period.\nTotal Score: 55/70 (approximately 79%)\nThis analysis places Arbitrum in the “Fully Non-Sovereign” category, though with a lower score than Polygon zkEVM. The main differences come from the challenge period required for absolute finality and the reliance on fraud proofs rather than validity proofs.\nStacks Settlement Guarantees (10/10 weight): Score: 4/10 Stacks uses Bitcoin for checkpointing and security anchoring However, it lacks cryptographic enforcement of settlement by Bitcoin’s consensus Bitcoin doesn’t automatically enforce or validate Stacks’ state transitions Falls into the “checkpoint systems” category rather than stronger settlement guarantees Dispute Resolution (9/10 weight): Score: 3/10 While Stacks records its state on Bitcoin, Bitcoin’s consensus doesn’t serve as the ultimate arbiter Disputes are primarily resolved within Stacks’ own consensus mechanism Bitcoin can’t automatically correct or resolve issues in Stacks’ state Economic Security Inheritance (8/10 weight): Score: 6/10 Miners must commit actual Bitcoin through PoX mechanism This creates some economic security dependency on Bitcoin However, Stacks maintains its own economic incentives through STX State Finality (7/10 weight): Score: 5/10 Stacks achieves finality through a combination of its own consensus and Bitcoin anchoring State is recorded on Bitcoin but not in a way that Bitcoin consensus enforces Provides stronger finality than fully independent chains but weaker than true L2s Exit Rights Guarantees (6/10 weight): Score: 4/10 With sBTC, users can move Bitcoin between chains However, this relies on Stacks’ mechanisms rather than being guaranteed by Bitcoin’s consensus Exit rights depend on threshold signatures rather than cryptographic guarantees State Progression Dependency (5/10 weight): Score: 7/10 Stacks blocks are linked to Bitcoin blocks through PoX State progression is tied to Bitcoin’s block progression However, Stacks can still process transactions independently within this framework Asset Movement (4/10 weight): Score: 5/10 sBTC enables Bitcoin movement between chains But this movement isn’t directly enforced by Bitcoin’s consensus Relies on threshold signatures and Stacks’ mechanisms Total Score: 34/59 (approximately 58%)\nThis places Stacks in the “Moderately Dependent” category on our spectrum.",

This analysis examines major exploit categories based on historical hacks, their prevalence across different application models, and effective mitigation strategies.\nSubcategories are: Access Control Flaws Logic and Arithmetic Errors Oracle Manipulation Reentrancy attacks Flash Loan Vulnerabilities\nReentrancy attacks Mainly on Solidity. Famous example is the DAO hack which resulted in the Ethereum. pre 0.4.0 of Solidity there were no built in protections, so completely vulnerable.\nPre-0.4.0: No built-in protections, completely vulnerable 0.4.0-0.4.12: Introduction of the transfer() function with 2300 gas stipend, providing some protection but not comprehensive 0.4.13-0.7.x: Better compiler warnings about state changes after external calls 0.8.0+: Enhanced static analysis for potential reentrancy, but still requires explicit protection\nOpenZeppelin’s ReentrancyGuard became the gold standard for protecting against these attacks.\nMove, used by Sui and Aptos, takes a different approach. It uses a linear type system that treats resources as non-duplicatable assets. This makes traditional reentrancy attacks much harder because resources can’t be accessed multiple times in the same transaction. However, parallel execution in Sui could potentially create new forms of reentrancy-like vulnerabilities.\nHigh Risk (without additional protections): Solidity (EVM) - Requires explicit guards and careful external call handling Medium Risk: Cairo (StarkNet) - Possible but harder to accidentally create Cadence (Flow) - Resource model helps but inter-contract calls need attention Low Risk (by design): Move (Sui/Aptos) - Linear type system prevents traditional reentrancy Rust (Solana) - Execution model prevents traditional reentrancy Vyper (EVM) - Built-in restrictions prevent common reentrancy patterns Clarity (Stacks) - Decidability and no recursive calls prevent traditional reentrancy",

    "text": "Sovereign Networks\nWe would prefer to use the term Decentralized Incentive Network instead of blockchain. But we also want to align on common nomenclature within the industry, so we’ll stick with Blockchain for now.\nThe point of blockchains:\nCensorship resistance is indeed crucial - it enables truly permissionless systems where no entity can prevent valid transactions. However, there are several other compelling candidates for blockchain’s primary purpose: One strong contender is deterministic state transition. Think about how traditional databases or financial systems might have ambiguity about the exact sequence or timing of transactions, especially across different locations or institutions. Blockchain provides absolute clarity about state changes - there’s no ambiguity about which transaction came first or what the exact state was at any given moment. This property enables complex financial systems and smart contracts to operate with complete predictability. Another fundamental purpose could be creating credible neutrality in computational systems. This goes beyond just censorship resistance - it’s about creating systems where the rules are explicit, unchangeable without consensus, and apply equally to all participants. Traditional systems often have hidden biases or special privileges for certain users, while blockchain systems enforce their rules uniformly through code. We could also argue that the primary purpose is enabling trustless coordination at scale. Before blockchain, coordinating economic activity among untrusting parties required trusted intermediaries like banks or governments. Blockchain enables direct peer-to-peer coordination without these intermediaries, potentially reducing costs and increasing efficiency. Asset digitization and ownership might be another contender. Blockchain enables digital scarcity and verifiable ownership in ways that weren’t possible before. This property enables everything from cryptocurrencies to NFTs to tokenized real-world assets.\nWe won’t be taking any idealogical approach to the point of blockchains but rather applying scores to DIN’s and then comparing that to how the market values them.\nA decentralized incentive network with state consensus\nI’ve tried to simplify our definition as much as possible and even still it’s verbose. Read that sentence to 99% of the world and I’ll they’ll give you a quizzical look and move onto the section about meme coins. There’s a lesson there. A lesson the technical luminaries in this space ignore at their peril. Accessibility matters.\nLet’s break down each component of our definition.\nDecentralized. This is how many Nodes participate. Centralized means 1. Therefore anything more than 1 is decentralized.\nNetwork. This loosely means the participants computers/machines communicate via a communication method.\nState Consensus. The network will record state and all nodes will agree about the state via consensus.\nWe don’t need to worry too much about consensus yet, but you just need to know that the nodes must agree on the state. For example if Bob sends Alice 10 BTC. Everyone on the network must come to an agreement that Bob did indeed send Alice 10 BTC. Another important characteristic is that even if everyone agrees today, in the future that can’t be disputed or changed. This is another important category called censorship resistance. We’ll get to it.\nDependent Networks\nA sovereign chain can be defined as a network that maintains complete independence in its settlement process, requiring no external chain to validate or guarantee its state transitions. This independence is fundamental to the concept of sovereignty in blockchain networks.\nThis section should start discussing why the need arose for dependent networks. Specifically Ethereum struggling with scale. Due to the trilemna: decentralization security scalability\nLet’s talk about scaling strategies monolithic Bigger blocks Faster blocks Higher minimum requirements for nodes Consensus optimizations modular Execution - The current crop of L2’s Data availability - Storing and accessing blockchain data Celestia Consensus - Agreeing on the state of the network Settlement - Finalizing transactions and providing security guarantees. Ethereum and Bitcoin in the current Layer craze\nPure Value Networks Pure value networks stick to the fundamental purpose of moving and storing value, avoiding the additional complexity that comes with being a platform for applications or other services.\nWhat makes these networks “pure value” is what they don’t include: They don’t support complex smart contracts They don’t host decentralized applications They don’t provide programmable functionality beyond basic value transfer They don’t serve as platforms for other tokens or applications\nApplication Chains Application Chains represent networks that go beyond pure value transfer to support various types of applications. They’re divided into three main categories: Hubs, Specialized, and Generalized chains.\nHub Application Chains serve as central connection points in the blockchain ecosystem.\nSpecialized Application Chains focus on specific use cases or industries.\nGeneralized Application Chains aim to support a wide range of applications but differ from hubs in that they’re not necessarily trying to be central connection points.\nThe key distinction between these categories lies in their approach to applications: - Hubs prioritize becoming central platforms that other networks depend on - Specialized chains optimize everything for specific use cases - Generalized chains provide broad functionality but focus on being self-contained ecosystems",

This means Ethereum is shit at scaling.\nSo we need to talk about the theory of Layers in Blockchain\nThat’s why L2’s became a major part of the roadmap. How does the scalability limitation affect the network. Congestion and high gas fee’s. So people don’t interact on the chain and it hits a ceiling. So logically we should start any discussion with transaction fee’s, as that’s the direct result of the scalability failure and the main reason users use L2’s. Besides yield opportunities.\nSo we should first consider the Fee Markets on Ethereum and Bitcoin which are the two major chains looking to scale with L2’s. There is a lot of debate and a lot of misinformation around this topic.\nDependent networks can really be divided into chains: External DIN required to validate state transitions External DIN required to guarantee state transitions\nWe’ll define a framework for how we define a Dependent Network. There are few things we look at, in terms of priority: censorship resistance. Polygon zkEVM sequencer can censure, but you can go through the contract directly on Ethereum theoretically if censorship occurs. Same thing for Arbitrum. Although this is a very weak guarantee due to the complexity for regular users. For Stacks, it’s more censorship resistant that the other two. Also if I were to interact directly with the smart contract on Ethereum, that makes the L2’s pointless. Why do I need them if not to deal with congestion and high gas. dispute resolution. I believe all chains need to hard fork. Potentially not Movement due to Move’s resource model. None of the chains will automatically hard fork if a dispute is found. settlement. So the base chain must validate and guarantee state transitions on the dependent chain. This is kinda stupid. It’s guaranteeing the state transitions but makes no attempt to resolve things like censorship resistance. finality of settlement. Optimistic 7 days, zk 30 minutes, Stacks 16 hours economic security model inheritance - this is actually pointless as it just means the state transitions match the rules. Nothing about censorship resistance.\nSo my qualification of dependent networks means that they must inherit the censorship resistance of the base chain, settlement must be validated and guaranteed by the base chain, dispute resolution must be automatic and/or decentralized. else the chain can just fork.\nSettlement Types In order of strength Cryptographically enforced settlement Validity proofs

    "text": "This section will compare how Blockchains implement the three tiers of traditional governance. Namely:\n\nLegistlative - Who makes the rules and how they created\nExecutive - Who executes the rules\nJudicial - Referee between them\n\nSo in Bitcoin BIP’s cover the Legislative aspect, Executive is Node operators for Networks then for dapps it gets more complex. Judicial is where it gets challenging. This is pretty much the entire community. People interpret rules by economic activity and nodes. Look at Bitcoin Cash. No money. So everyone agreed with the block size of Bitcoin.\nThere is also the concept of Canvassing or Lobbying can also occur. Let’s look at Ethereum. If I wanted to increase the gas limit from 30 million to 31 million. I’d need to canvas all the nodes to come along with me. Currently there is 5,333 nodes. So I’d need to convince ~3k node operators to increase the gas limit.\n\n1. Hard Forks\n\nDefinition: Protocol changes that make previously invalid blocks/transactions valid (or vice-versa), requiring all nodes to upgrade\nCharacteristics:\n\nNon-backwards compatible\nRequires coordinated network upgrade\nCreates potential for chain splits if not unanimously adopted\n\nUse Cases: Major protocol upgrades, fundamental rule changes, bug fixes\nExamples: Ethereum’s merge to PoS, Bitcoin’s SegWit upgrade\n\n\n\n2. Soft Forks\n\nDefinition: Backwards-compatible protocol changes that tighten rules without invalidating existing blocks\nCharacteristics:\n\nBackwards compatible\nOld nodes can still participate (with limitations)\nLower coordination requirements\n\nUse Cases: Adding new features, incremental improvements\nExamples: Bitcoin’s P2SH implementation, taproot upgrade\n\n\n\n3. Parameter Updates\n\nDefinition: Changes to network variables within predefined bounds\nCharacteristics:\n\nNo code changes required\nOften automated through on-chain governance\nLower risk than protocol changes\n\nUse Cases: Fee adjustments, block size modifications, staking parameters\nExamples: Tezos’ regular parameter updates, Cosmos’ governance parameters\n\n\n\nGovernance Mechanisms\n\n1.

Web3 more closely aligns with the breadth of our industry.\nBelow you can see how the web has evolved into Web3.\n\n\n\nEvolution of the Web\n\n\n\nWeb1 (1990s): static websites, read-only content\nWeb2 (2000s - 2010s): Interactive social platforms, user-generated content\nWeb3 (2020s+): Decentralized networks, blockchain, user-owned data and assets\n\n\n\nDecentralization\n\n\n\nNetwork Topologies\n\n\n\n\nBlockchains\n\nLayer 1\nCurrently there is no formally and universally accepted definition of what comprises a L1 Network.\nWe have taken these sources in order to come up with our definition:\n\n(Nakamoto 2008) for Bitcoin\n(Buterin 2013) for Ethereum\n(Buterin 2021) for the rollups guide\n(Charbonneau 2023) for John’s excellent guide to rollups\n\nNakamoto’s Bitcoin whitepaper, while not explicitly using the term “Layer 1,” established the core principles of what we now recognize as Layer 1 characteristics: a base protocol that handles consensus, security, and data availability without relying on any other blockchain system. This introduced the concept of a self-contained, sovereign blockchain network.\nThe Ethereum whitepaper expanded this foundation by introducing programmability and demonstrating that a Layer 1 could be more than just a payment system. It showed that a Layer 1 blockchain serves as a foundation for broader computational capabilities while maintaining the core properties of decentralization and security.\nButerin’s rollup guide helps define Layer 1 by contrast - it clarifies what makes a base layer distinct from scaling solutions built on top of it. This work emphasizes that a Layer 1 blockchain must handle three critical functions: data availability, consensus, and execution, all while maintaining decentralization.\nCharbonneau’s report further refines our understanding by examining how Layer 1 blockchains interact with scaling solutions, highlighting their role as the security and settlement layer of the blockchain ecosystem.\nSynthesizing these sources, we can define a Layer 1 blockchain as:\nA sovereign blockchain network that provides three fundamental guarantees without relying on any other blockchain system:\n\nconsensus - the ability to agree on the state of the network\ndata availability - ensuring all transaction data is publicly accessible and verifiable\nexecution - the processing of transactions and state changes. It must do this while maintaining decentralization in its security model and serving as the ultimate settlement layer where the final state of all transactions is recorded.\n\n\nSettlement Layer\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLayer 2\nThere is no canonical definition of L2’s.\nWe use:\n\n(Gluchowski 2019)\n(Poon and Buterin 2017)\n(Poon and Dryja 2016)\n(Buterin 2021)\n(Charbonneau 2023)\n\nTo come up with the following Framework\n\nData Availability\n\n\nOn-chain (Rollups)\nOff-chain (Validiums, Plasma, Sidechains)\n\n\nSecurity Model\n\n\nInherited from L1 (Rollups, Validiums)\nIndependent (Sidechains)\nHybrid (Plasma)\n\n\nState Validation\n\n\nFraud Proofs (Optimistic Rollups)\nValidity Proofs (ZK Rollups, Validiums)\nIndependent (Sidechains)\nMerkle Roots (Plasma)\n\n\nSettlement Mechanism\n\n\nDirect (Rollups)\nChallenge Period (Optimistic Rollups)\nExit Games (Plasma)\nBridge/Peg (Sidechains)",

    "text": "General Terms\n\nSmol Brain\nBig Brain\nGigabrain\nFUD (Fear, Uncertainty, Doubt): While not strictly a meme, it’s become memefied in crypto culture. Any negative news or criticism is often dismissed as “FUD” by cryptocurrency enthusiasts, sometimes ironically.\n“When Lambo?”: This phrase emerged during the 2017 bull run, representing the dream of getting rich enough from crypto to buy a Lamborghini. It’s both used seriously by newcomers and ironically by veterans.\nDiamond Hands / Paper Hands: Popularized during the GameStop saga but heavily adopted in crypto. “Diamond hands” refers to holders who don’t sell despite market pressure, while “paper hands” sell at the first sign of trouble.\n“This is good for Bitcoin”: Originally used seriously, it became ironic as people would claim any news, even negative, was somehow positive for Bitcoin’s adoption or price.\nBogdanoff Twins (“Dump It”): These memes feature the late Bogdanoff twins supposedly controlling the crypto markets, ordering price dumps right after someone buys or pumps after they sell.\n“Funds are SAFU”: From a Binance CEO video where he mispronounced “safe,” this became a way to reassure (often ironically) about exchange security.\n\n\nCommon Characters\n\n\n\nCrypto characters\n\n\n\nWojak/NPC: Originally from 4chan, this simple face drawing represents the average retail trader who buys high and sells low. It’s often paired with the “feels guy” emotion variations, particularly during market crashes.\nSoyjak: a derogatory variation of Wojak used to mock people perceived as overly enthusiastic, naive, or conformist. The term combines “soy” (from the controversial and scientifically unsupported claim that soy consumption reduces masculinity) with “Wojak.”\nCoomer: a derogatory variation of Wojak used to mock people perceived as overly enthusiastic, naive, or conformist. The term combines “soy” (from the controversial and scientifically unsupported claim that soy consumption reduces masculinity) with “Wojak.”",
