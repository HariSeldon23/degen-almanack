    "text": "The cryptocurrency revolution has created unprecedented opportunities for financial independence, but it has also spawned an industry rife with exploitation. As someone deeply embedded in this world, I face a moral dilemma: I can either participate in a system that profits from obscuring knowledge, or I can work to make that knowledge freely accessible to all.\nThis Almanack represents my choice of the latter path. Just as the cypherpunks believed privacy and freedom of information could coexist, I believe we can build a more equitable crypto ecosystem without compromising its innovative potential. The fundamental act of friendship among cryptocurrency enthusiasts – what I call “degens” – should be the sharing of knowledge, not the hoarding of it.\nThe technical complexity of cryptocurrency has created a particularly insidious form of gatekeeping. Essential market data and analysis hide behind expensive paywalls. Crucial insights remain locked in exclusive chat groups and private networks. This artificial scarcity of knowledge directly contradicts the core ethos of Web3: permissionless access and decentralized power.\nThis Almanack aims to break down these barriers. It will serve as a comprehensive, freely accessible resource covering everything from basic concepts to advanced trading strategies. More importantly, it will evolve through community contributions, ensuring it stays relevant and accurate as the industry develops.\nSome might question why I would freely share knowledge that others sell at a premium. My answer is simple: the long-term health of our ecosystem depends on educated participants making informed decisions. When knowledge is concentrated in the hands of a few, it creates the very centralization of power that cryptocurrency was meant to disrupt.\nLooking ahead, I envision this Almanack becoming a living document that adapts to the rapid changes in our industry. I’m exploring sustainable open-source funding models, potentially through platforms like Mirror that allow for anonymous contributions. This would ensure the Almanack can continue growing while maintaining its independence from traditional financial incentives.\nThis is just the beginning. The path to truly democratized crypto knowledge will require continuous effort and collaboration. If you share this vision, I invite you to contribute your expertise, suggest improvements, or simply help spread the word. Together, we can build something that honors the original promise of cryptocurrency: financial sovereignty for all.\nThe work begins now.",

    "text": "The crypto industry suffers from a unique paradox: those with the deepest knowledge often have the strongest incentives to obscure rather than illuminate. This troubling reality became clear to me during a technical debate I witnessed on Twitter. Both participants made valid points, yet instead of building understanding, they resorted to personal attacks. What struck me wasn’t just the hostility, but the absence of a shared framework for discussion – a common language that could bridge their perspectives.\nThis observation rekindled an idea I’d been considering for years: creating a comprehensive blockchain taxonomy. But as I began mapping out the technical architecture of various networks, I realized the scope needed to be much broader. The same knowledge gaps that hindered technical discussions were even more pronounced in everyday conversations about cryptocurrency investment and usage.\nI thought about the countless conversations I’ve had with friends and family seeking crypto advice. These weren’t developers or traders – they were curious individuals trying to understand a complex new technology. Despite years of experience in the industry, I struggled to give them guidance that was both accessible and comprehensive. The existing resources either oversimplified to the point of uselessness or drowned readers in technical jargon.\nThis Almanack aims to bridge that gap. Drawing inspiration from Henry Varnum Poor’s Manual of Railroads, which brought transparency to America’s railway boom, we’re creating a resource that serves both technical and non-technical audiences. Just as Poor’s manual helped investors understand the revolutionary technology of his time, this Almanack aims to demystify the crypto revolution for everyone.\nThe name “Trollip’s Degen Almanack” might seem unusual. Initially, I considered calling it a blockchain taxonomy or a Web3 guide. But these terms felt too limiting. The word “degen” – short for degenerate – carries special meaning in crypto culture. While often used ironically to describe risk-taking traders, being a degen also implies deep engagement with the technology and markets. It’s through this engaged experimentation that true understanding emerges.\nWhat sets this Almanack apart is its commitment to intellectual honesty and practical utility. We’re building it as an open-source, community-reviewed resource that will evolve alongside the technology it describes. The documentation uses version control through Git, allowing readers to track how understanding changes over time. As the industry matures, we plan to integrate real-time data sources, transforming this from a static document into a dynamic tool for decision-making.\nThe Almanack is organized into distinct paths catering to different needs:\n\nThe Path to Independence guides those seeking financial sovereignty\nThe Technologist’s Path provides deep technical understanding\nThe Financial sections offer frameworks for analysis and investment\n\nEach section builds upon the others, creating a comprehensive resource that grows with your understanding. Whether you’re a developer looking to understand economic implications, an investor studying technical fundamentals, or someone simply seeking financial independence, you’ll find your path forward here.\nThis is an ambitious undertaking, and like any first edition, it will contain errors and omissions. But by maintaining rigorous standards for evidence, encouraging community contributions, and staying true to the open-source ethos, we aim to create something valuable: a trusted guide through the often confusing world of cryptocurrency and Web3.\nThe journey begins here.

It exists on a spectrum:\n\nArchitectural Decentralization: How many physical computers comprise the system?\nPolitical Decentralization: How many individuals or organizations control those computers?\nLogical Decentralization: Does the interface and data structures appear more like a single monolithic object, or an amorphous swarm?\n\nExamples help illustrate these distinctions:\n\nBitcoin is architecturally and politically decentralized but logically centralized (one shared ledger)\nEmail is architecturally decentralized but politically centralized (few major providers) and logically centralized (standardized protocol)\nLanguage is decentralized across all three dimensions\n\n\n\nBlockchain\nA blockchain is a distributed database that maintains a continuously growing list of records (blocks) that are cryptographically linked to previous records. Key characteristics include:\n\nImmutability: Once data is recorded, it cannot be altered without changing all subsequent blocks\nTransparency: All transactions are public and verifiable\nConsensus: Network participants agree on the state of the system without trusting each other\n\nThe term “blockchain” has become somewhat limiting - many modern systems use different data structures while maintaining similar properties.

    "section": "",
    "text": "The story of digital independence begins not with blockchains or cryptocurrencies, but with a profound recognition: the tools that brought unprecedented convenience to our lives have also created unprecedented control over them.\nConsider your daily financial life. Your morning coffee purchase creates a data point. Your salary arrives through systems you don’t control. Your savings exist primarily as numbers in someone else’s database. This convenience comes with hidden costs - your transactions can be blocked, your accounts frozen, your privacy compromised. Each small sacrifice of control seemed reasonable in isolation, but together they’ve created golden handcuffs of financial dependence.\nThis isn’t accidental. The post-industrial financial system runs on centralization because it’s efficient. Banks can process thousands of transactions per second. Credit cards work seamlessly across borders. Mobile payments happen with a fingerprint. But this efficiency masks a fundamental truth - you’re asking permission to use your own money.\nThe early cypherpunks understood this tradeoff. In 1993, Eric Hughes wrote in the Cypherpunk Manifesto:\n“Privacy is necessary for an open society in the electronic age. Privacy is not secrecy. A private matter is something one doesn’t want the whole world to know, but a secret matter is something one doesn’t want anybody to know. Privacy is the power to selectively reveal oneself to the world.”\nThey saw that digital privacy would become inseparable from freedom. Without privacy in our transactions and communications, true independence would be impossible. But they also understood that simply criticizing the system wasn’t enough - they needed to build alternatives.\nThis brings us to public key cryptography, the foundation of digital independence. Imagine having a special lock that anyone can use to send you messages or money, but only you can open. No permission needed, no middlemen required, no central authority to approve or deny. This isn’t just technical theory - it’s a practical tool for independence.\nBitcoin emerged from this foundation, but it would be a mistake to see it as just digital money. It proved that we could create systems where trust comes from mathematics and consensus rather than institutions. Where rules are enforced by code rather than policy. Where participation is permissionless rather than granted.\nThe path to digital independence isn’t about rejecting modern convenience - it’s about reclaiming control while preserving it. We’ll learn to:\n\nHold assets that can’t be frozen or seized\nCommunicate without surveillance\nTrade without gatekeepers\nBuild systems that resist control\n\nBut this power comes with responsibility. In traditional systems, mistakes can often be reversed. Passwords can be reset. Transactions can be disputed. In truly independent systems, you alone are responsible for your security. Your privacy. Your choices.\nThis Almanack exists because that responsibility requires knowledge. Not just technical knowledge, though that’s important, but practical wisdom. Understanding not just how these systems work, but why they matter. Learning not just to use tools, but to think independently about digital freedom.\nThe journey of digital independence is both personal and collective. Each person who takes control of their digital life strengthens the network for everyone. Each developer who builds privacy-preserving tools expands what’s possible. We’re not just users of a new system - we’re participants in its evolution.\nIn the coming chapters, we’ll explore both the philosophical foundations and practical tools of digital independence. Whether you’re a developer looking to build these systems or someone seeking to use them, understanding these foundations is essential. Because digital independence isn’t given - it’s learned, practiced, and ultimately, earned.",

    "title": "The Path to Digital Money",
    "section": "",
    "text": "From Ciphers to Smart Contracts\nThe story of cryptocurrency begins long before Bitcoin. It starts with a simple question that has challenged mathematicians and philosophers for millennia: How can we share secrets safely?\nAncient Rome used the Caesar cipher to protect military communications. Medieval merchants developed complex codes to secure trade routes. During World War II, the breaking of the Enigma machine’s encryption changed the course of history. Each advance in cryptography came from the need to communicate privately in an unsafe world.\nBut the true revolution began in the 1970s with two breakthroughs that would eventually make digital money possible: public key cryptography and the development of secure network protocols.\nIn 1976, Whitfield Diffie and Martin Hellman solved a problem that had seemed impossible: how could two people who had never met establish a shared secret over an insecure channel? Their solution, known as public key cryptography, created the foundation for secure digital communications. A few years later, Ron Rivest, Adi Shamir, and Leonard Adleman developed the RSA algorithm, making these theoretical ideas practical.\nThe 1980s saw the birth of the Cypherpunk movement. These technologists and privacy advocates believed that cryptography could protect individual liberty in the digital age. They weren’t just mathematicians – they were philosophers who saw privacy as essential to human dignity and freedom.\nDavid Chaum, a pioneer in cryptographic privacy, proposed the first digital cash system in 1983. His DigiCash company later implemented these ideas, but ultimately failed – partly because it remained centralized, requiring trust in a single company.\nThe 1990s brought both advances and setbacks. Phil Zimmermann released PGP (Pretty Good Privacy), bringing strong encryption to everyday users. The U.S. government, viewing strong cryptography as a national security threat, tried to mandate backdoors through the Clipper Chip. The resulting “Crypto Wars” ended with cryptography being classified as protected speech.\nThrough these battles, the Cypherpunks refined their vision. In 1993, Eric Hughes published “A Cypherpunk’s Manifesto,” declaring that “privacy is necessary for an open society in the electronic age.” The movement explored various approaches to digital money: Nick Szabo’s bit gold, Wei Dai’s b-money, and Adam Back’s Hashcash all contributed crucial ideas.\nThen came 2008. As the global financial system teetered on the brink of collapse, an anonymous figure calling themselves Satoshi Nakamoto published a paper titled “Bitcoin: A Peer-to-Peer Electronic Cash System.” Bitcoin solved a problem that had stymied previous attempts at digital money: how to achieve consensus about ownership without trusting any central authority.\nBitcoin’s genius lay in combining existing technologies in a novel way. It used public key cryptography for identity, cryptographic hash functions for mining, and a distributed ledger to record transactions. Most importantly, it created an economic incentive structure that made the system self-sustaining.\nThe early Bitcoin years were marked by experimentation and growing pains. The first known commercial transaction occurred in 2010 when Laszlo Hanyecz paid 10,000 BTC for two pizzas – bitcoins that would later be worth hundreds of millions of dollars. Mt. Gox, the largest Bitcoin exchange, collapsed in 2014, teaching harsh lessons about the risks of centralized custody.\nBy 2013, a young programmer named Vitalik Buterin saw both Bitcoin’s potential and its limitations. Bitcoin’s simple scripting language was intentionally restricted to prevent complex computations that could slow the network. Buterin proposed Ethereum, a platform that would add a complete programming language to blockchain technology.\nEthereum launched in 2015, introducing the concept of smart contracts – self-executing programs stored on the blockchain. This opened up entirely new possibilities. Instead of just transferring value, users could create complex financial instruments, digital organizations, and decentralized applications.\nThe next major innovation came in 2018 with the launch of Uniswap, which introduced automated market makers (AMMs) to crypto. Traditional order book exchanges require active market makers to provide liquidity. AMMs used smart contracts to create passive, algorithm-driven markets that could operate 24/7 without human intervention.\nThis sparked the DeFi (Decentralized Finance) revolution. Compound introduced algorithmic lending markets. Aave pioneered flash loans. Curve optimized stable asset trading. Each innovation built on previous ones, creating increasingly sophisticated financial infrastructure.\nBut Ethereum’s success brought scaling challenges. High transaction fees during peak usage made smaller transactions impractical. This spurred development of alternative approaches. Solana launched in 2020, using a proof-of-history mechanism to achieve higher throughput. The Move programming language, first developed for Facebook’s Libra project, influenced platforms like Aptos and Sui that prioritized safer smart contract development.\nLayer 2 scaling solutions emerged as another approach. Optimistic rollups like Arbitrum and Optimism, and zero-knowledge rollups like zkSync and StarkNet, aimed to increase Ethereum’s capacity while inheriting its security. Each made different tradeoffs between speed, cost, and decentralization.\nThis brings us to today. We’ve moved from simple ciphers to programmable money, from centralized experiments to decentralized networks. Each step built on previous innovations while solving new challenges. Understanding this history helps us appreciate both how far we’ve come and the challenges that still lie ahead.\nThe cypherpunks believed privacy tools could reshape society. They were right, but perhaps not in the way they expected. Cryptocurrency has indeed changed how we think about money, but its greatest impact may be in showing that alternative financial systems are possible. As we look to the future, we carry forward their core insight: mathematical tools, properly designed, can create new forms of human coordination and freedom.",

The same industry that began as a rebellion against financial intermediaries now builds new forms of intermediation. Venture capital firms that once missed the internet boom now rush to stake their claims.

Mass adoption requires user-friendly interfaces, institutional investment needs regulatory clarity, and complex systems benefit from specialized service providers. But other changes represent a more fundamental drift from crypto’s founding principles.\nConsider how: - “Not your keys, not your coins” became “Trust our custody solution” - “Censorship resistant” became “Compliant with all regulations” - “Trustless” became “Trust our proprietary trading engine” - “Decentralized” became “Controlled by a small group of token holders”",

Privacy-preserving protocols operate alongside regulated exchanges.\nThe challenge ahead lies in preserving crypto’s essential promise – financial sovereignty, censorship resistance, and trustless operation – while making these benefits accessible to ordinary users. This might mean:\n\nBuilding better self-custody solutions that match centralized convenience\nCreating privacy-preserving compliance mechanisms\nDeveloping truly decentralized governance systems\nFocusing on real-world utility over speculation\nMaintaining open protocols alongside commercial services\n\nThe original vision of cryptocurrency remains powerful: a world where financial freedom doesn’t require anyone’s permission, where privacy is protected by mathematics rather than policies, and where trust comes from transparent code rather than opaque institutions. Realizing this vision means neither rejecting all compromise nor accepting every dilution of principle, but rather finding ways to make radical ideas practical.\nFor both regular people and technologists seeking alternatives to centralized systems, the core question remains: How do we build systems that preserve freedom while serving human needs?

While traditional finance relies on banks, brokers, and other intermediaries, DeFi uses smart contracts – self-executing computer programs – to enable direct peer-to-peer financial activities. This shift removes gatekeepers and creates opportunities for anyone with an internet connection to access sophisticated financial services.\nWhile Ethereum pioneered DeFi, its high transaction costs can make learning expensive, with fees sometimes exceeding $50 per transaction. This is why we’ll start our journey on Base, a Layer 2 network built on top of Ethereum. Base offers the same capabilities but with dramatically lower fees, typically under $1 per transaction.

Gox collapse in 2014.\nCultural Impact: - Serves as a constant reminder of cryptocurrency’s original purpose: financial self-sovereignty - Often shared after exchange hacks or failures - Has evolved into a teaching tool for newcomers - Frequently referenced in discussions about centralized exchanges and custody solutions\nReal-world examples that reinforced this meme: - Mt. Gox (2014): 850,000 BTC lost - QuadrigaCX (2019): $190 million lost - FTX (2022): Billions in customer funds lost\n\n\nHODL\nPerhaps the most famous cryptocurrency meme, “HODL” originated from a typo that became a battle cry for long-term investors.\nOrigin: December 18, 2013, when GameKyuubi posted “I AM HODLING” on the BitcoinTalk forum during a market crash. The poster, admittedly drunk, wrote a passionate defense of holding Bitcoin despite price volatility.\nEvolution: 1. Initial phase: Simple misspelling joke 2. Secondary meaning: “Hold On for Dear Life” 3. Modern usage: Philosophical approach to cryptocurrency investment\nCultural significance: - Represents conviction in long-term value over short-term trading - Creates solidarity among investors during market downturns - Differentiates investment approaches (HODLers vs. traders) - Has spawned related terms like “diamond hands”",

These building blocks make it possible to create systems with unprecedented security properties.\nConsider how these tools work together: When you make a blockchain transaction, you use a private key to create a signature (public key cryptography), which is then combined with transaction data to create a unique identifier (hash functions), which might be verified privately (zero-knowledge proofs). Understanding these primitives helps you see not just how current systems work, but how future ones might be designed.",

So logically we should start any discussion with transaction fee’s, as that’s the direct result of the scalability failure and the main reason users use L2’s.

Polygon zkEVM sequencer can censure, but you can go through the contract directly on Ethereum theoretically if censorship occurs. Same thing for Arbitrum. Although this is a very weak guarantee due to the complexity for regular users. For Stacks, it’s more censorship resistant that the other two. Also if I were to interact directly with the smart contract on Ethereum, that makes the L2’s pointless. Why do I need them if not to deal with congestion and high gas. dispute resolution. I believe all chains need to hard fork. Potentially not Movement due to Move’s resource model. None of the chains will automatically hard fork if a dispute is found.\nsettlement. So the base chain must validate and guarantee state transitions on the dependent chain. This is kinda stupid. It’s guaranteeing the state transitions but makes no attempt to resolve things like censorship resistance.\nfinality of settlement. Optimistic 7 days, zk 30 minutes, Stacks 16 hours\neconomic security model inheritance - this is actually pointless as it just means the state transitions match the rules. Nothing about censorship resistance.\n\nSo my qualification of dependent networks means that they must inherit the censorship resistance of the base chain, settlement must be validated and guaranteed by the base chain, dispute resolution must be automatic and/or decentralized. else the chain can just fork.\nSettlement Types In order of strength\n\nCryptographically enforced settlement\nValidity proofs\nFraud proof systems\nCheckpoint systems",

In Web3, gas serves a similar fundamental purpose - it’s the essential resource that powers all blockchain operations. But unlike postage or gasoline, blockchain gas represents something more complex: it’s a dynamic pricing mechanism that manages network resources, incentivizes operators, and helps secure the entire system.\nThis chapter explores gas from multiple perspectives: as a practical tool users must understand, as a technical mechanism that enables network operation, and as an economic system that shapes Web3’s evolution.",

    "text": "Dependent Network Ratings\nPolygon zkEVM Settlement Guarantees (10/10 weight): Score: 9/10 The zkEVM uses zero-knowledge proofs to validate all state transitions. Every transaction batch includes a proof that mathematically demonstrates the correctness of all computations and state changes. These proofs are verified by Ethereum’s consensus mechanism, providing cryptographic certainty that state transitions are valid. This is nearly the highest level of settlement guarantee possible, just slightly below fully integrated L2s because of some optimizations in the proving system.\nDispute Resolution (9/10 weight): Score: 10/10 Ethereum serves as the absolute source of truth for the zkEVM. If there’s ever a dispute about the state, the zero-knowledge proofs verified by Ethereum’s consensus provide mathematical certainty about what is correct. There’s no dependency on fraud proofs or challenge periods - the cryptographic proofs mean disputes are resolved immediately and with absolute certainty by Ethereum.\nEconomic Security Inheritance (8/10 weight): Score: 9/10 The zkEVM inherits its fundamental security from Ethereum. The validity proofs mean it can’t confirm invalid state transitions, and its assets are secured by Ethereum’s consensus mechanism. While it has its own token (MATIC) for gas fees and other purposes, the core economic security - particularly for assets like ETH and tokens - comes directly from Ethereum.\nState Finality (7/10 weight): Score: 9/10 Once Ethereum confirms a zkEVM batch and its validity proof, that state is final with the same guarantees as Ethereum itself. The mathematical nature of the zero-knowledge proofs means there’s no waiting period for finality beyond Ethereum’s own finality period. This is as strong as state finality can get for a settlement-dependent network.\nExit Rights Guarantees (6/10 weight): Score: 8/10 Users can always withdraw their assets back to Ethereum by submitting a withdrawal request. These withdrawals are guaranteed by Ethereum’s consensus - once a withdrawal is proven valid through a ZK proof, no one can prevent the user from claiming their assets on Ethereum. The only limitation is the normal proving and processing time.\nState Progression Dependency (5/10 weight): Score: 7/10 While the zkEVM can process transactions independently, it can’t finalize new states without submitting proofs to Ethereum and having them verified. This creates a strong dependency on Ethereum for state progression, though there’s some independence in transaction processing.\nAsset Movement (4/10 weight): Score: 10/10 Native ETH and ERC-20 tokens can move seamlessly between Ethereum and the zkEVM. When assets move to the zkEVM, they’re locked on Ethereum and can only be unlocked through valid proofs. This provides the strongest possible guarantees for asset movement between the networks.\nTotal Score: 62/70 (approximately 89%)\nThis analysis places Polygon zkEVM firmly in the “Fully Non-Sovereign” category. Arbitrum Let me analyze Arbitrum’s relationship with Ethereum as a Settlement-Dependent Network by carefully examining each criterion. This will help us understand how optimistic rollups differ from ZK rollups in their settlement dependency.\nSettlement Guarantees (10/10 weight): Score: 7/10 Arbitrum uses an optimistic rollup design where transactions are assumed valid but can be challenged during a dispute period (currently 7 days). While this provides strong settlement guarantees, it’s not as immediate or mathematically certain as ZK rollups. The challenge period introduces a time-based element to settlement finality. However, the ability to prove fraud on Ethereum’s consensus layer still makes this a robust settlement mechanism.\nDispute Resolution (9/10 weight): Score: 8/10 Ethereum serves as the ultimate arbiter for Arbitrum through its fraud proof system. If someone identifies an invalid state transition, they can submit a fraud proof to Ethereum, which will automatically resolve the dispute and revert invalid transactions. This is strong dispute resolution, though not as immediate as ZK proofs since it requires active challengers and a challenge period. The key strength is that Ethereum’s consensus automatically enforces the correct resolution once fraud is proven.\nEconomic Security Inheritance (8/10 weight): Score: 9/10 Arbitrum inherits its fundamental security from Ethereum. The ability to prove fraud on Ethereum means that any attempt to corrupt Arbitrum’s state would require corrupting Ethereum itself. The sequencer role adds some centralization risk, but the fundamental economic security - particularly for assets - comes directly from Ethereum. Users can always force transactions through Ethereum if the sequencer fails.\nState Finality (7/10 weight): Score: 6/10 While Arbitrum’s state updates are recorded on Ethereum, true finality requires waiting through the challenge period. This creates a tradeoff between practical finality (which can be quite fast) and absolute finality (which requires waiting for the challenge period). This is lower than ZK rollups where finality is immediate once proofs are verified.\nExit Rights Guarantees (6/10 weight): Score: 8/10 Users can always withdraw their assets to Ethereum, guaranteed by Ethereum’s consensus. While withdrawals require waiting through the challenge period, they cannot be prevented by Arbitrum’s operators. The delay is longer than with ZK rollups, but the guarantee is just as strong once the period passes.\nState Progression Dependency (5/10 weight): Score: 7/10 Arbitrum can process transactions independently but must submit state roots to Ethereum for potential verification. While it has more processing independence than some systems, it ultimately depends on Ethereum for final state confirmation, especially during disputes.\nAsset Movement (4/10 weight): Score: 10/10 Native ETH and ERC-20 tokens move seamlessly between Ethereum and Arbitrum through a strong bridge mechanism backed by Ethereum’s consensus. When assets move to Arbitrum, they’re locked on Ethereum and can only be unlocked through valid withdrawals after the challenge period.\nTotal Score: 55/70 (approximately 79%)\nThis analysis places Arbitrum in the “Fully Non-Sovereign” category, though with a lower score than Polygon zkEVM. The main differences come from the challenge period required for absolute finality and the reliance on fraud proofs rather than validity proofs.\nStacks Settlement Guarantees (10/10 weight): Score: 4/10 Stacks uses Bitcoin for checkpointing and security anchoring However, it lacks cryptographic enforcement of settlement by Bitcoin’s consensus Bitcoin doesn’t automatically enforce or validate Stacks’ state transitions Falls into the “checkpoint systems” category rather than stronger settlement guarantees Dispute Resolution (9/10 weight): Score: 3/10 While Stacks records its state on Bitcoin, Bitcoin’s consensus doesn’t serve as the ultimate arbiter Disputes are primarily resolved within Stacks’ own consensus mechanism Bitcoin can’t automatically correct or resolve issues in Stacks’ state Economic Security Inheritance (8/10 weight): Score: 6/10 Miners must commit actual Bitcoin through PoX mechanism This creates some economic security dependency on Bitcoin However, Stacks maintains its own economic incentives through STX State Finality (7/10 weight): Score: 5/10 Stacks achieves finality through a combination of its own consensus and Bitcoin anchoring State is recorded on Bitcoin but not in a way that Bitcoin consensus enforces Provides stronger finality than fully independent chains but weaker than true L2s Exit Rights Guarantees (6/10 weight): Score: 4/10 With sBTC, users can move Bitcoin between chains However, this relies on Stacks’ mechanisms rather than being guaranteed by Bitcoin’s consensus Exit rights depend on threshold signatures rather than cryptographic guarantees State Progression Dependency (5/10 weight): Score: 7/10 Stacks blocks are linked to Bitcoin blocks through PoX State progression is tied to Bitcoin’s block progression However, Stacks can still process transactions independently within this framework Asset Movement (4/10 weight): Score: 5/10 sBTC enables Bitcoin movement between chains But this movement isn’t directly enforced by Bitcoin’s consensus Relies on threshold signatures and Stacks’ mechanisms Total Score: 34/59 (approximately 58%)\nThis places Stacks in the “Moderately Dependent” category on our spectrum.",

    "text": "BTC\nBitcoin has emerged as the world’s first successful digital store of value, creating a new paradigm for wealth preservation in the digital age. Much like gold served ancient civilizations through to modern times as a reliable store of wealth, Bitcoin provides similar characteristics but with distinct advantages native to the digital realm.\nAt its foundation, Bitcoin’s value proposition rests on its absolute scarcity - there will never be more than 21 million bitcoins. This hard cap, combined with a transparent and immutable issuance schedule through mining “halvings” every four years, creates a predictability that even gold, with its uncertain mining output, cannot match. When new gold deposits are discovered or mining technology improves, supply can increase unexpectedly. Bitcoin’s supply schedule, in contrast, is mathematically certain.\nBitcoin’s digital nature offers significant advantages over traditional stores of value. Unlike gold, it can be transferred instantly across borders, divided into microscopic units, stored without physical vault costs, and verified for authenticity without specialized equipment. Its self-custody properties allow individuals to maintain direct control over their wealth without relying on third-party custodians or financial institutions.\nThe network’s security model, backed by massive computational power through proof-of-work mining, has proven remarkably resilient over more than a decade. This track record has gradually built confidence among institutional investors, who increasingly view Bitcoin as a legitimate asset class for portfolio diversification and inflation hedging. Major financial institutions now offer Bitcoin investment products, while some corporations have adopted it as a treasury reserve asset.\nWhile Bitcoin began as a peer-to-peer electronic cash system, its evolution into a store of value mirrors how gold transformed from a medium of exchange into a wealth preservation tool. The emergence of Layer 2 solutions like the Lightning Network now handles Bitcoin’s payments functionality, allowing the base layer to focus on its primary role as digital gold - the foundational layer of monetary security in the cryptocurrency ecosystem.",

    "text": "Derivatives\n\ncbBTC\nCoinbase Base Bitcoin (cbBTC) represents a novel approach to Bitcoin tokenization, launched by Coinbase to bridge the gap between Bitcoin and Ethereum-based DeFi applications. It functions as an institutional-grade wrapped version of Bitcoin, backed 1:1 by actual Bitcoin held in Coinbase’s custody. What makes cbBTC particularly noteworthy is its institutional focus, leveraging Coinbase’s reputation as a publicly traded company and its robust custody infrastructure to provide a secure and regulated way to use Bitcoin across different blockchain ecosystems.\nThe technical architecture of cbBTC operates through a burn-and-mint mechanism on the Base network, Coinbase’s layer-2 blockchain built on top of Ethereum. When users deposit Bitcoin into Coinbase’s custody, an equivalent amount of cbBTC is minted on Base. This process allows Bitcoin holders to participate in Base’s growing DeFi ecosystem while maintaining exposure to Bitcoin’s value. The token implements additional security measures, including proof of reserves and regular audits, making it particularly appealing to institutional investors who require high levels of security and regulatory compliance. Unlike some other wrapped Bitcoin tokens, cbBTC’s key differentiator is its direct integration with Coinbase’s established infrastructure and its focus on institutional-grade security and compliance measures.",

    "text": "ETH\nEthereum represents a revolutionary leap in computing - it’s humanity’s first attempt at creating a global, decentralized computer that’s always running and accessible to everyone. Like how the internet connected computers worldwide for information sharing, Ethereum connects computers globally to create a single, unified computational platform that no one controls but everyone can use.\nThink of Ethereum as a massive, worldwide computer with some unique properties: it never shuts down, can’t be censored, and maintains perfect records of everything it processes. Instead of storing photos or documents like a regular computer, this world computer specializes in running smart contracts - pieces of code that automatically execute agreements and handle digital assets without needing intermediaries.\nETH, the network’s native asset, serves as the essential “fuel” that powers this world computer. Every computation, whether it’s processing a DeFi trade or minting an NFT, requires ETH to run. After Ethereum’s transition to Proof of Stake through The Merge, ETH also gained a new role - network validators must stake ETH to participate in securing the network, similar to how a computer needs electricity to function and stay secure.\nWhat makes Ethereum truly revolutionary is its programmability. Just as early personal computers transformed from specialized calculators into general-purpose machines that could run any software, Ethereum evolved blockchain technology from a simple transaction ledger into a platform that can run any programmable application. This has spawned entire new industries: decentralized finance (DeFi) protocols that operate 24/7 without human intervention, NFT marketplaces that enable digital ownership and royalties, and DAOs that coordinate human activity through code rather than hierarchies.\nThe platform continues to evolve through ambitious technical upgrades. Layer 2 scaling solutions like rollups act as specialized processors that handle heavy computations off the main chain, while the planned implementation of sharding will divide the network into parallel processing units - similar to how modern computers use multiple cores to increase performance. These improvements aim to make the world computer more efficient and accessible while maintaining its core properties of decentralization and security.\nAs this world computer grows in capability and adoption, ETH’s value proposition strengthens - it’s not just a digital asset, but the essential resource needed to access and use what might become the foundation of our digital future.",

    "text": "This section will compare how Blockchains implement the three tiers of traditional governance. Namely:\n\nLegistlative - Who makes the rules and how they created\nExecutive - Who executes the rules\nJudicial - Referee between them\n\nSo in Bitcoin BIP’s cover the Legislative aspect, Executive is Node operators for Networks then for dapps it gets more complex. Judicial is where it gets challenging. This is pretty much the entire community. People interpret rules by economic activity and nodes. Look at Bitcoin Cash. No money. So everyone agreed with the block size of Bitcoin.\nThere is also the concept of Canvassing or Lobbying can also occur. Let’s look at Ethereum. If I wanted to increase the gas limit from 30 million to 31 million. I’d need to canvas all the nodes to come along with me. Currently there is 5,333 nodes. So I’d need to convince ~3k node operators to increase the gas limit.\n\n1. Hard Forks\n\nDefinition: Protocol changes that make previously invalid blocks/transactions valid (or vice-versa), requiring all nodes to upgrade\nCharacteristics:\n\nNon-backwards compatible\nRequires coordinated network upgrade\nCreates potential for chain splits if not unanimously adopted\n\nUse Cases: Major protocol upgrades, fundamental rule changes, bug fixes\nExamples: Ethereum’s merge to PoS, Bitcoin’s SegWit upgrade\n\n\n\n2. Soft Forks\n\nDefinition: Backwards-compatible protocol changes that tighten rules without invalidating existing blocks\nCharacteristics:\n\nBackwards compatible\nOld nodes can still participate (with limitations)\nLower coordination requirements\n\nUse Cases: Adding new features, incremental improvements\nExamples: Bitcoin’s P2SH implementation, taproot upgrade\n\n\n\n3. Parameter Updates\n\nDefinition: Changes to network variables within predefined bounds\nCharacteristics:\n\nNo code changes required\nOften automated through on-chain governance\nLower risk than protocol changes\n\nUse Cases: Fee adjustments, block size modifications, staking parameters\nExamples: Tezos’ regular parameter updates, Cosmos’ governance parameters\n\n\n\nGovernance Mechanisms\n\n1. Off-Chain Governance\n\nCharacteristics:\n\nSocial consensus through discussion forums, social media, conferences\nInformal decision-making processes\nRelies on node operator coordination\n\nAdvantages:\n\nFlexible and adaptable\nAllows for nuanced discussion\nNatural resistance to capture\n\nDisadvantages:\n\nCan be slow and messy\nMay lack clear resolution mechanisms\nPotential for contentious outcomes\n\n\n\n\n2. On-Chain Governance\n\nCharacteristics:\n\nFormal voting mechanisms\nSmart contract-based execution\nToken-weighted or identity-based participation\n\nAdvantages:\n\nClear process and outcomes\nAutomated execution\nTransparent participation\n\nDisadvantages:\n\nPotential plutocratic capture\nReduced flexibility\nVoter apathy risks\n\n\n\n\n3. Hybrid Systems\n\nCharacteristics:\n\nCombines off-chain discussion with on-chain execution\nMultiple stages of proposal refinement\nMixed participation models\n\nAdvantages:\n\nBalances flexibility with formality\nCombines benefits of both approaches\nCan adapt to different types of changes\n\nExamples: Polkadot’s governance system, Cosmos Hub’s proposal process\n\n\n\n\nImprovement Proposal Systems\n\n1. Structure\n\nStages:\n\nDraft: Initial proposal development\nReview: Community feedback and refinement\nLast Call: Final period for major objections\nAccepted/Final: Ready for implementation\nRejected: Proposal declined\n\nComponents:\n\nTechnical specification\nMotivation and rationale\nBackwards compatibility analysis\nReference implementation (if applicable)\nSecurity considerations\n\n\n\n\n2. Common Frameworks\n\nBIP (Bitcoin Improvement Proposals):\n\nFocus on consensus changes\nConservative approach\nHigh emphasis on security\n\nEIP (Ethereum Improvement Proposals):\n\nMultiple tracks (Core, ERC, Interface)\nRegular cadence of updates\nStrong emphasis on standardization\n\nNetwork-Specific Systems:\n\nCustomized to network needs\nVarying levels of formality\nDifferent voting thresholds\n\n\n\n\n\nCentralization Factors\n\n1. Development Centralization\n\nCore Development Teams:\n\nControl over codebase\nTechnical expertise concentration\nFunding dependencies\n\nClient Implementation:\n\nDiversity of node software\nImplementation independence\nBug discovery and fixes\n\n\n\n\n2.
